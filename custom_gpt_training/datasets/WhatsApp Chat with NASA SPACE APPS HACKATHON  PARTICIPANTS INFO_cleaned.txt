Yes I was in the previous cohort
Please inbox... This platform is specified for the NASA Hackathon
They even sent mi a link on ma email saying that i fill the form to secure my ticket which i did like a week back, yesterday they brought out the sheet and i also filled it mind you all these forms capture the same data and now i have to sub the same data ti @256780303603 in data normalization thats not right cause it encourages data redundancy thats why dabase management systems were developed and as if we are still using file based systems
Thanks
i was just suggesting and i stand to be corrected
What's the time??
90 secs times all the times i have been doing it equals????
We're IT guys you can just retrieve data from all those forms we have been feeling cause eve the sheet was asking for team name and team head's number

Congratulations & Thank You for Participating in the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge.
On behalf of NASA and our 15 Space Agency Partners from around the world, we would like to thank you for participating in this year’s hackathon and celebrating our theme of “The Sun Touches Everything” with NASA Heliophysics. We hope you learned something new, met interesting people from a global community of problem-solvers, dreamers, and innovators, and had fun
Kindly fill out form to share your hackathon experience
*Heartfelt gratitude for your contribution to the success of the NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala 2024 Hackathon.*
Dear Principal, Management, and Staff of UICT,
I hope this message finds you well. On behalf of the organizing committee for the NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala 2024 Hackathon, I wish to express our deepest gratitude for your invaluable sponsorship, guidance, and contributions, which played a pivotal role in the event's ultimate success, held on the 5th and 6th of October 2024.
Your support enabled us to host participants from UICT and other tertiary institutions across Uganda, providing them with an unparalleled platform to innovate and collaborate. The event attracted key partners including the National ICT Innovation Hub, UCC, STI, NITA-U, and RENU, whose engagement amplified the impact of the hackathon, positioning it as a key event for fostering technological creativity in Uganda.
We are immensely grateful to the mentors and judges from both academia and the ICT industry, who provided valuable guidance and feedback, sharpening the participants' skills and enhancing the quality of their innovative solutions.
A special thank you also goes out to the organizing committee, which worked tirelessly across various teams—student volunteers led by the NASA local lead Elijah Akena, welfare, registration, media, security, marketing, finance, procurement, and facilities. Their seamless coordination ensured the smooth running of the hackathon and an inspiring experience for all involved.
The collective contributions of everyone involved have significantly boosted innovation efforts, particularly in increasing the number of initiatives that hold the potential for commercialization. Your support has directly contributed to strengthening Uganda’s innovation ecosystem.
We are committed to providing a comprehensive report with further details of the event’s success and recommendations on the way forward for the innovations birthed during this hackathon. We also look forward to collaborating further on nurturing and commercializing these innovative ideas.
Once again, thank you for your unwavering support and for being a critical part of this journey toward technological advancement in Uganda.
Best regards,
Gastervas G. Rutwara

Note:
- CNH stands for Carteira Nacional de Habilitação, which is the Brazilian driver's license.

Would you like me to help with anything else?
@13135550002  prove that you never hallucinated
As an AI, I don't have consciousness or personal experiences, so I don't "hallucinate" in the classical sense. Hallucinations are typically associated with human brains and cognitive processes.
However, I can provide information on what "hallucination" means in AI contexts:
In AI, "hallucination" refers to instances where a model:
1. Generates incorrect or nonsensical information.
2. Produces outputs unrelated to the input or context.
3. Creates fictional or unrealistic data.
To mitigate hallucinations, AI models like myself employ various techniques:
1. Training on diverse, high-quality data.
2. Regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
3. Evaluation metrics to detect inaccuracies.
4. Continuous updates and improvements.
If you have specific concerns or questions about AI hallucinations or my performance, feel free to ask!

Hello hackers

Yes sir

Thank you
You dodged my registration for confirmation😉
It was not our intention, sir. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.🙏
What is the challenge you attempted?
SDGs in the Classroom. <This message was edited>
Please get the link and register for records
Were you online or you had a mentor?
We registered online, and created the team online.
I sent an email to your address, sir, with our summary slides.
So you had no assigned mentor - right?
Kindly clarify which link this is in reference to.
No, sir. We did not.
Noted
However, I was liaising with Eli Jah, as I had been chosen to mobilize from my college at Makerere.
Hence all guidance we had besides what was shared in the sessions was from him.
Much appreciated.🙏

you pipo don't start
Thank you you'all.🙏🙏
bt I didn't mean that
its just that I hate not being able to win
Sorry naye we're all winners just that Agrisun are more winners on the show
wait 4 me next time☝️
Yeah
Confirm Ai WOn or Your real  brains WOn😄😄
Its their brains that used AI and won cause you also had access to AI naye u couldn't win them🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
😃😃😃😃 Am not Worried of anyone who uses Artificial Intelligence. Ask me why.. Because they never understand what they are doing....Just copy and paste.
I wish some one could develope banking SOFTWARE with A.I and then it crashes. You will see empty TINS.
naye guys cool it
Not every one is able to use AI to get the right answers next time learn to accept defeat wama Congs AgriSun members  though i wanna know how you won us *#AL-Tech Sphere Solutions* 😂😂😂😂😂
it is fair in love and war
Trust me I know those guys. In real life "Zero matter" in brain Trust me. Take away A.I and give them bare machines with only softwares required. You will see porridge. #in good faith
Change is a factor of life we're now in era of AI so you have to learn how to use it so that u be dope gwe you think why didn't Nasa say that don't use AI tools?????
If Ministry of ICT and National Guidance wants to have the BEST TALENT IN TECH. Then Trust me A.I should be rulled out of HACKATHONS. We need to develop a Talent pool that THINKS for Creative Solutions. BUT NOT COPY & PASTE.
The point deliver innovations no matter the way as longer as they are impactful kati gwe you will think mbu oliwakitalo nyo naye nga........... First read through those guys project description btw
someone forward this to the concerned with all due respect. Trust me I have been at DEFCON. Hackers do it REAL and extra creative. Have you ever wondered why our background keeps being AGRICULTURE and NOT TECH.🫡🫡🫡is because of that mentality of wanting easy GO.!
AI is meant to enhance productivity, failure to adopt to refine your prompt engineering skills then boom many parties will always win you.
Use your fresh brains + an AI assistant to brainstorm and explore the greatness in you
Hahaha! I love where this is going. Hope you have enough RAM. as I will ride you to overflow🫡🫡
Better learn how to AI otherwise u will be replaced for nothing
Hahaha please don't be brain washed. to believe that  its' marketing Strategy 101
Hope you didn't use AI to respond to me in this format.
For real guys! I thank the organizing committe for the initiative. However, next time I request if we truly want to bring the best out of our Nation @256780303603 I request we level the play ground to critical thinking not A.I copied thinking as most participants here feel attacked. But that's the fact.!
AI is my field of study, and I understand so well it's working structure , it's  power & it's weakness and where it's headed to
One day you will understand that head is the person, earth is hard and water is wet
yoo just chill, you'll win next time
Please remove "EMOTIONS" lets look at the facts.
He will never win with his mentality even if he is alone in the competition
Relax! Wining is just an adrenaline rush of satisfaction. But grasping the matter is KEY
I didn't realize there was a "Gang" of A.I lovers here.
Adapt or accept to be left behind.
We're in the new era ssebo
AI is just repository of knowledge with reasoning capabilities to help you easily find what you need if you know specially what you want and so  it saves you browsing the whole internet searching nosense content.
I don't see any problem using it because it's not even creative as per now.
Only I wish you could see the backend of it 😀😀
Next time try to appreciate pipo's success and achievements that when you make it also naye undermining yo fellows achievements mbu they didn't use their brains is childish thinking do u know what it takes in Tech to come up with something appealing in the shortest time of less than 48 hours oba u just comment because you have data and phone????
Once again congs to the winners
Oh! that's interesting I though I was speaking to someone with more A.I knowledge and keeping up with trend as you claim.😄😄
Go read about TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE, that's when you will start appreciating AI 😎😎😎
Okay! "FEELINGS ASIDE" Did you use you BRAIN ALONE? If yes then am WRONG. else Am so sorry for my Country's generation of thinkers "Ai. Thinkers"
this guy is an enemy of progress
a very big hater
Haha. I want to read your book "ADDING SOMETHING INTO A.I DIMENSIONS" I want to see you in Guiness world not piloting stuff written by other people. How shall we uplift our continent's digital infrastructure if we can't CREATE but ONLY USE
Wish you luck, next time better Chief 🤞🙏
You would say. I SPIT FACTS and let it PAIN you. But once you realize I was RIGHT. You RE-ADJUST your Knowledge Acquisition PATH.
are you tired of the DIgital fight. A fight of intellectual matter
seems you just love attention then.
So the phone and sim card yo using you created them
Fake nigga looking for attension
Guys lets chill him
it's overrated. Am a GHOST with FACTS
haaha finally ! We have a direction to start with
How can you create if you too lazy to understand what other people have done 🤣🤣🤣.
You have few processed information that's why you too bias
So when it comes to real stuff. You feel over powered because you understand less of the digital space. I really want to see how far you 0s and 1s knowledge can go beyond chatgpt.
Please don't use A.I to reply to my Text I will smoke you out
you really have none
Try me I have bundles just to smoke fake digital players. Make sure you have enough matter. <This message was edited>
I have no point to prove bro, just following your concerns.
Guy Large Language Models became a success after invention of a technology called ATTENTION MECHANISM.
So always to try pay attention to things around you and try to make meaning out of them that when you start being creative.
Ignorance will take you nowhere
Make it clear that ignorance plus arguments of refusing to adopt to knowledge
Well represented 🤝

Do you guys mean that this is the end of the journey. Are the teams who are six and above not going for international judging?
Dear participants, please note that, based on the number of teams that submitted their projects before midnight, the NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala is qualified to recommend only five teams for global evaluation, as per the guidelines. We are currently finalizing plans for official communication regarding the next steps for the winners and the award of certificates for all participants. Please be patient with us🙏🏾

Awarding ceremony kawaniki bro
Gwe nawee stop sending your bi pics they wea for only selected people and you are here shouting
tell them
i think they were taking ghost photos for the attendees
Next time don't forget to Carry your camera 📸.
It will always be a better option🤣🤣.
I believe that @256780303603 did his best to organize the hackathon.
Thank you.
*And we shall book u take the pics never invite or organize events u can't handle 😉*
Of all things your problems are on the pictures, because you couldn't spot yourself in the gallery amongst many.. That sounds funny,..
The Hackathon attracted 42 teams and more than 160+ participants who successfully submitted their projects,. And were well catered for in the 48 hours of the Hackathon,.
Learn to appreciate and give credits rather weighing in small things over the bigger picture,. We all had our phones anyway..
The event went on successful.
Only that I couldn't satisfy your personal interests as if we could spot you for pictures as a guest of honor or judges.🤦🤣🤣
I shall credit whatever needs to be
And I shall not keep lol-key over wat didn't go well
How comes you're not talking about the most successful things, because it was 90%  successful.. Negative energy doesn't help sir,. Keep it low. <This message was edited>
For your only understanding everything way right which isn't the case to everyone that tym management poor like it was the 1st time they were organizing,
Anyway it wasn't of my interest to say this right here but for the better I had to.
Good morning to you all and stay blessed

before u judge hv u watched it upto end yo solution is deya
Also check this one out 👆👆👆 there a lot of facts they gave which are very valid if you use Uganda as case study but there's was generally spread throughout all of Africa
And honestly if we don't work on those areas raised there, Africa will continue to keep where we are currently whether we have the resources, raw materials or favorable geographic locations in world it won't matter much if we aren't utilizing them or giving them that privilege to foreigners instead of utilizing it ourselves🤌

Dear NASA Space Apps Participants,
We want to inform you that the upcoming award ceremony has been delayed upon submitting a facilitation concept letter to The Science, Technology and Innovation Secretariat, seeking to identify promising projects that align with their objectives for further incubation.
We are currently awaiting official feedback, which will help us determine the new date for the awards. We appreciate your patience during this time and apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.
Thank you for your understanding.

Subject: Apology for Delays and Update on Next Steps Following the NASA Space Apps Hackathon
Dear NASA Space Apps Participants,
I hope you are doing well.
First and foremost, I want to sincerely apologize for the delays in communication regarding the next steps after the hackathon. We understand that you may have been waiting for updates, and we truly appreciate your patience.
At the moment, we are engaged in discussions with the Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) to finalize the next steps, including organizing the prize ceremony and exploring how the promising projects can be supported and implemented within their capacity.
Given the ongoing discussions, I kindly ask that you bear with us for a little longer. We aim to reach out next week with more concrete details on how we will move forward with the STI’s support.
Once again, thank you for your understanding and continued enthusiasm. We greatly value your participation and look forward to updating you soon.
Best regards,
Local Lead, NASA Space Apps

good afternoon everyone .Does anyone know any information on Uganda's pearl sat 1 <This message was edited>
Uganda's first satellite?
I heard mbu yafiira yo wagulu 😅
Uganda's what??🤔🤔🤔
Cause i knew the truth
Thats UICT for you
so wait whats the truth?
satelie
Uganda's first satellite
Yeah, Govt lacked funds to keep it in space and it was removed. Even it was inefficient
But it was  launched in China not Uganda though they told u that is for uganda,but Ugandaz  atmosphere and the orbits couldn't support it <This message was edited>
Wat do u mean by "on China"
Okay, the newspapers wrote "It was developed by 3 ugandans with support by Japanese in kyushu-japan"
I didn't hear anything related to China
Guys, the statelites expire, it depends on the kind of statelite you purchase. The one uganda made was to last a year
Some time this year a new one was launched
So don't down play yourselves
Let's celebrate international volunteers Day together.
😅 where these intended for this group and on a side note can you physically build one from scratch because this link is mostly for the theory "calculations" 😴😴
can you build a simple linear power supply using those components that can output 5v with enough current to charge up your phone, now that's a more fun practical build 😁😁
That's very simple bro... maybe if you said that we build a 3phase inverter with DC source and supplying a 3phase load like in Variable Speed Drives.. that's more fun

The problem is not sending the money the problem is tapping his link
This is the shit they send you at the end and expect the victim to send money 👆👆👆and it's probably the dumbest scam have seen
😂😂 you think people can trust a stranger enough to send money just because you promising them millions????
Okay sir, do you confirm that at the end your friends won't tell us mbu to send "money" for validation?? <This message was edited>
He's a junior scammer
Though they have a network of people
I know these guys bt we had to know how they hack the whatsapp but we finally found out and we also hacked them back from their email
👆👆👆 but bro right here it shows that you sent 300k to them and received 3.5mill *"apparently"*
At that point  my watsapp was hacked send me that photo I c😂
I wasn't in control ov my account
😂 you are claiming your WhatsApp was hacked after sending that link here like bro
You would have just deleted them from the group then and how are you able to reply with the same account?? <This message was edited>

*Updates on the Next Steps for NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala 2024 Participants*
Good morning NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala 2024 Participants,
Thank you for your patience as we awaited a response from the STI Aeronautics Bureau team lead. It was essential to seek their guidance to ensure that our innovation activities and events are sustainable and foster long-term impact rather than stopping at short-term rewards.
I am pleased to share that, after discussing the guidance received from the STI - Aeronautics Bureau with the Local Lead, Mr. Akena Elijah, we have agreed to align with the revised plan. This plan involves combining the best groups selected from the NASA Space Apps Challenge Kampala 2024 with STI’s group of innovators in a one-day, non-residential Aerospace Innovators Workshop. During this workshop, awards will be presented following further competitions.
We encourage you to continue refining your innovations and preparing for this opportunity. This workshop will serve as a valuable platform for you to learn, collaborate, and advance your projects further.
We will provide additional guidance soon regarding specific timelines and how you can best prepare for the workshop.
Thank you once again for your dedication and enthusiasm. We look forward to supporting your journey as you continue to innovate.
_Warm regards & Merry Christmas_ 🙋🏾‍♂️
Gastervas G. Rutwara

Matthew 4:16-17 (KJV)  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Elijah @⁨Eli Jah NASA Space Apps⁩ and Gustavo,.
Should participants and selected winning teams of NASA SPACE APPS KAMPALA still have any hopes for next steps as it was promised,  or we call it an end to last year's NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE, KAMPALA.
There were promised of Awards,  and taking teams to boot camp,. But there's no prior communication.
📢📢📢📢
When i told you to wait for this year's competitions u thought i was joking naye i know uict and its administration very well now lets wait for 6th&7th march for this year's challenge
Otherwise good night @256780196215
🤣🤣
We apologise, we didn't take you serious yet you knew 🤣🤣 <This message was edited>
😂😂😂 me the moment they said mbu simanya we are talking with oba who and who for money to organize i knew it was a scam
Why would a big institution like that play with Innovators' mind? It's good to not to raise hopes too high for people,  if it can't be met. Now it looks like people were used for lobbying and abandoned along the way.
Let's move on, there is a lot out there to fight for
We have moved on.
The problem is, we're still being given hopes 😂
They should just tell us to forget about it. And it's a wrap
Remove all the hopes u have bro
Hopes removed. 👍 👍
From now you will heal 🙏🙏🙏😂😂
