On a separate note, Ms. Betty has requested that I remind everyone to complete their registration payments en fulfill all necessary requirements as soon as possible to avoid any complications or penalties.

For example:
- Monday: Group A - Programming (morning), Group B - Fundamentals of IT (morning)
- Monday: Group A - Fundamentals of IT (after morning break), Group B - Programming (after morning break)
Please ensure you attend classes with your designated group, as this will be used for grading purposes. Let's stay organized en make the most of our lectures.
Each group has its own group leader en his/her assistant. Please know that, respect is reciprocal, if yuh dont respect your class leaders, unity en teamwork will be so inadequate en remember, I have always told yuh that Teamwork = Success.

Let Kalinzi Philip lead the prayer 🙏
We are honored dear God for the life you have bestowed upon us. The great love with WIC you loved us that you sent us your beloved son to die and ransom us for you.
Bless us this day so that it may be fruitful. Be with us and shield always from harm's way
I pray this in Jesus' name.
Amen
Someone shout amen

Hello to all computer scientist
Hai
Good night guys
Hello
You guys, good morning
Mng
How are you man
Am cool n u
Is there lecture today
Great
Yes
Ok
But their is party as well
Ok
Lectures are there ate maanyi
Gud mng to  u  all the products of  a sin
Nedda sebo, we are products of love 😌
I just wanted people's opinions
Man was created by a loving God, man and woman met out of love. The end product of that love was me, you, her and him. Even rape products, the loving God couldn't let them be if He didn't love them.☺️
U will ask ur self where cain got his wife yet they were produced as boys only
And Adam and eve had many sons and daughters
Gen. 5:4 Cain married one of his sister'
Man which Bible is this and which version
Any
This is the scarcity mentality of some christians, they think up to date they're sons and daughters of Adam
Do you want to see the words that Cain married his sister
U man if I come to realize u , I will hand u over to SU 4 bible study
Elaborate the scarcity coz the bible beautifully brings it out
There are over 132k christian factions all with bible studies
Why should trust yours
I believe the bible to be very clear
We are children of Adam from the lineage of Seth. Coz only Seth's descendants survived the flood. Or 🤔 you have some other revelation
So wat about Zeus
That's Greek Mythology, just like you have Kintu and Nambi here
Paul addresses this question beautifully in Acts 17:16-32
Let this be our morning devotion🥹🌹☺️
But pipo lets be at campus today to witness the launch of the 30th Nov project
Wat time

Am not wat u think i am 😭😭😂😂😂
@256782470261  what's up <This message was edited>
We are in 4 the lecture on a serious note
The lecturer is seriously conducting a lecture
its fine
Understand the lecture very well,,u will teach us too
that's it
some of a already at home after being told that there is no lecture 2de
This is on the class representative
He said there were no lectures today
Ik ..guys should be clear...now people are at home knowing there wouldn't be lectures today...
those attending let them attend, imagine moving bak to campus twice
eyo wats that
Are you home
That transport 💀
Nope
for sure
It's just the beginning
But atleast next time if there are absolutely no lectures and confirmed by the lecturers..they should let us know
daz it
📢💨📢
Guys, today is freshers ball en never had we been at campus for lectures wen such an event is ongoing.
1. I made the communication in our main DCS group where we have the AR en all our lecturers. Why didnt they object it..??
2. Mr. Kamba is also in that group, why didnt he send a message that he's to turn up, cause he's eligible to sending messages at any time. <This message was edited>
For sure this isnot fair
Wama doesn't be apologetic, it's not your fault. You made a communication to them
So in simple terms it's on the lecturer...not us
So are we gonna have the next lecture,,so that we come plz
True
It's not his fault at all
Still in bed 🛌
Temubigenda yoo...
Ekyo nakyo kigwe 📌
Abaliyo mujja tusomesa.
Communication is always key, so, we did our part .
I know right... atleast we can make it for the next one
Thank you 🤝
So guys tell us if we are gonna hv the next lecture
At least we try and cm
So should we turn up the next one?
📢💨📢
I jhus talked to the guild president, Mr. Nkwanga en he's like, most lecturers are not at campus for lectures en all lectures will have to be aborted in the coming hours tho we cant be conclusive at the moment.📌
Understand what he's teaching, you'll take us through
That's the better solution
So can he teach us as group B
I personally can't turn up, campus is a long way from home
Yes
This is why efficient communication is key
Yeah, and Mr. Kamba ignored that fact
30.11.2024
📌
The biggest day of the year
You'll have to add CSS for the borders
How , help me pliz
<style>
table, th, td {
border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
Put that in your head section
After html
Ineed that the right time that it should end
Yes, you missed the head section
Today's lecture there is no any female student only males.

Hey friends!
As we approach the 30th of November, I wanted to remind you all that this is not just a deadline, but an opportunity! Let's use this chance to take our campus connections to the next level by exploring our social bonds outside of the classroom.
Let's make unforgettable memories, strengthen our friendships, and create a support system that goes beyond the campus walls. Who says learning can't be fun?
Remember, our bond as students remains unbreakable, but let's take it a step further and build a community that thrives both in and out of school.
Let's make the most of this chance and create a memorable experience! Who's in?
Best, Yonah Odongkara

He said he will come for one lecture, he didn't specify on which one he was to miss
Ooh alright.

🥲 okay I'll make research , can I come for consultation?
Am coming with her
Yes we shall go 🚶🏾‍♀️
Easy guy
Haha no problem
Owaye the guy knows..
🫡
Waa not that much
Naye didn't understand the computational mathematics the guy taught oba on Wed.
but the guy waz clear, talk ov the programming guy
😂😂😂 we are in the same 🚣 boat
Hey, I see you're excited, but we’re just starting the course. It’s better to focus on the basics now so we understand everything. We can do more research later!
Programming guy taught himself, I didn't understand a thing😂
dat guy assumed we knew
yet we know nothing
Programming as programming is sm how hard coz most of the languages are hard and self taught so tomunenya
That question was very unnecessary for the first lecture
Ffe tuli be Gaza 👊 ohhhh ohhh
for sure
You should have gone for the basic content as the other lectures are doing
programming is not hard, it just needs time and frequent practice,  you all will do great
Ur ryt
Then u also look for me
That's cool that you're self-taught, but for those of us who aren't, it helps to go step by step with the class. It makes sure we all learn the basics properly before moving ahead.
We will, that is if you offer to help out
Kasta bwati ayogera 😅😅😅
😅😅she will discuse for us
Evn do the nxt numbers
Mwana atleast programming but website l understood nothing

You guys are already reading🤔😂
Shit is serious 😭
How about those who didn't pray 😔
What are you reading
Anyone who tried out the programming numbers please
Programming stuff, even os in the morning
ℕ𝕥 𝕤𝕚𝕞𝕡𝕝𝕖
I think vac was too long
𝔼𝕖𝕖𝕖𝕙 𝕙𝕞𝕞𝕞𝕞
Now guide me on programming question 2
𝕊𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕥 𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕙 𝕟𝕠 1
Am reading the introduction stuff, not tried the exercise
The lecturer did it,,,so let him start with number 2
Week one 🥹
𝕂𝕒𝕝𝕖
Remember there's no next term, it all begins and ends this sem
𝕆𝕜 𝕣𝕖𝕞𝕚𝕟𝕕 𝕙𝕚𝕞
Okay
Welcome back from the church, what does a pastor gain or lose when he or she pays tithe
That's him returning the Lord's share
𝕎𝕒 𝕥𝕠 𝕕𝕠 𝕨𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕨𝕖𝕟 𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕤𝕒𝕧𝕖 𝕣𝕒𝕥𝕖 𝕚𝕟 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕝𝕒𝕤𝕥 𝕒𝕗𝕔𝕠𝕟 𝕫 0.0%
Haaaaa..but he is one of the greatest goal keepers in premier league
ℂ𝕒𝕟 𝕦 𝕔𝕠𝕦𝕟𝕥 𝕕𝕒 𝕥𝕠𝕡
Make research
Man u fans believe in such
Make research and see
ℤ 𝕟𝕥 𝕕𝕒𝕥 𝕣𝕖𝕤𝕖𝕒𝕣𝕔𝕙
𝔼𝕧𝕖𝕣𝕪 𝕤𝕙𝕠𝕥 𝕠𝕟 𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕘𝕖𝕥 𝕨𝕒𝕤 𝕒 𝕘𝕠𝕒𝕝
hmmmmm, how many clean sheets does he have this season
This season isnot yet done,,let's look at last season
still waaaa onana mufu
Yes...this season he has 1/3
Onana football is different from that of Africans especially ugandans,,becoz he can even play not a matter of just kicking the ball
tulinde Tuesday tulabe
You guys can console your selves in any way 🙌😅
So let's go on Tuesday
mugambe, football is football. let simon know that how football is played can never differ
The style of play matters alot
mwana the goal post is a crucial position
null
𝕀 𝕡𝕝𝕒𝕪 𝕀𝕤𝕞𝕒𝕚𝕝 𝕨𝕒𝕥𝕖𝕟𝕘𝕒 𝕣𝕒𝕫𝕒 𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕟𝕒
𝕎𝕒𝕥𝕔𝕙 𝕕𝕖 𝕘𝕖𝕒 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕔𝕠𝕞𝕡𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕙𝕚𝕞 𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕙 𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕟𝕒
degea was much better
People can never be equal
𝔹𝕥 𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕟𝕒 𝕔𝕒𝕟𝕥 𝕓𝕖 𝕒 𝕣𝕖𝕡𝕝𝕒𝕔𝕖𝕞𝕖𝕟𝕥 𝕗𝕠𝕣 𝕕𝕖 𝕘𝕖𝕒
ono onana mufu
Depending on which style of play,,,
So how do you rate Onana to other EPL goal keepers, let's draw the line from your rating
hmmmmm
𝕎𝕔 𝕤𝕥𝕪𝕝𝕖 𝕠𝕗 𝕡𝕝𝕒𝕪
𝕖𝕒𝕤𝕥 𝕠𝕣 𝕨𝕖𝕤𝕥 ,𝕙𝕠𝕞𝕖 𝕫 𝕕𝕒 𝕓𝕖𝕤𝕥
The guy plays international football not villagish football
𝕆𝕜 2 𝕠𝕗 10
lets mention the goal keepers names and we rate individually
ℍ𝕞𝕞𝕞
that's not a big deal man
yo good aftanun too
we de, tongolo iz wat  am dreaming ov daily
For this  case let's rate Onana first. But I will rate this guys also
Emi Martinez
David Raya
Aron Ram...
Alison B
Ederson.
These are the most outstanding keepers in Epl to me
ya me too, the above mentioned amy best
but onana cant be compared with them, compare onana with Chelsea keeper instead
In my own perspective,  even Degea was better than him
𝔹𝕥 𝕟𝕥 𝕡𝕖𝕥𝕣𝕚𝕜𝕠𝕧𝕚𝕔 𝕦 𝕔𝕒𝕟 𝕣𝕒𝕥𝕖 𝕙𝕚𝕞 𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕙 𝕊𝕒𝕟𝕔𝕙𝕖𝕫
yeah, degea would keep many clean sheets in a season
even degea had more saves than onana in a single season
Olowooza Guvnor abiwulira😅
waaa, anti oyo super RED DEVIL fan
To u...butnot to the football statistics
onana only showcased good talent at inter
Give us some screen shots,  let's see how different staticians rate him
U people just have your personal feelings
anti oli man u fan
haha, only feelings ov losing
dat cant scare
U people always have a problem,,,for goals conceded,,we don't only look at the goal keeper,,also consider the defense
waaaa, that's wat we look at, we dont only see the general ranking
U and some of your fellows butnot the professionals
He even doesn't feature in the best 10 saving keepers
u want to rate yo self as one of the professionals
daz it
Ofcourse
Anyway well be back from munyonyo and others cricket oval
For me I was home watching them live

ehhhhh tukitegera kati awo deal iz at 100%
Some girls over applied makeups, I never wanted any dude to be scammed 😂😂
So we will have a surprise day for that
hahaha, wat type ov malpractice
we would put them in the rain 2de and we see who put make up or no,  koz rain can reveal them very well by washing away the powders and jelly creams
But worry not, we will surprise them one day at 3pm when the makeups have varnished
Yuh have a point 😂😂
anha that's the best time, but they will all flee
We will hold them, coz at that time, perfume scents would have gone, makeups gone, and real body settings will be in place
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am sponsoring one, I don't know whether she will allow.

POLL:
Group B class REPs??
OPTION: Cyrus and Aisha (11 votes)
OPTION: To vote others (2 votes)
📢💨📢
I said, send your names in my dm not here.
I won't work on anyone who's seding in the group.
Lets be organized
It’s important to focus on what really matters, like how responsible and supportive Sai has been. Judging him based on his dress code isn’t fair, especially when he's been there for everyone. Let’s appreciate his efforts and character instead.
Yeah
Ikr me to
There's maturity in this submission 👌
What about dressing code 🤔??? That alone can't justify anything.
I don't think that person who talked about Cyrus' dressing code can do what he have been doing, is doing and will do for us as we run this race
The way l know Sai
Dis guy can decide to come smart or even to worser than that cz u will neva change him....
But let’s put de dressing aside ad focus on the future of ourselves cause l assure u that no one can play the role Sai is playing it in this class cause even @256782470261is there suffering but he is just quite just de way men do it....
Nze am still with Sai in whatever state u put him in
Infact he is soon running in for Guild President of UICT 24/25 ate u should vote him👊
I think I'm the only one who doesn't know how Sai looks like
U should look for me dia
He doesn't need to know me
Okay...after lectures
U should know him cz he is the Guild to be ad u should be his secretary 🤒
Will be waiting
Secretary 😂atte why
To assist him in the office
Nuh I'm fine
Guys let our leaders continue because leadership is not all about the dressing code instead see your reps have the capacity to lead you,see far
Where is the next lecture
Now look at dis one
Totally offside
Anybody wid a more sensible answer?
Me i the reason we are many why can't others be taken to group b
Group B is also full

Is it a wrong word
Sir is even better than a professor ,only that u ugandans over misuse words
So all Ugandans except you don't know the meaning of "SIR"
It's only u and Afew fellows who misuse ,,,but we the majority dont
Anyway thanks for correcting me how I wish am ever talking you're a good teacher

📢💨📢
Hey folks,
As we move forward with our revisions en assignments, I encourage y'all to form groups of 4 people to work together.
This will facilitate collaboration, peer learning en shared responsibilities.
Please take some time to discuss en form your groups. Consider factors like complementary skills, strengths en learning styles when choosing your group members.
Once you've formed your groups, please let me know the names of the members in each group. This will help me keep track en provide support as needed.
Those groups "might" also be considered by some of our lecturers to assign course works en other constructive programs.
Remember, effective teamwork  en communication are essential for success. I'm looking forward to seeing y'all work together for the better.
Teamwork = Success
Okay
Thanks

*Have yuh guys ever had any website development lecture from either the labs or seminar room practically...???*
Not rili
nara
📢💨📢
Don't worry, it will be a different story this coming week buh note: its always better to normalize using one same PC whenever you are in the seminar room or labs for easy track of your work.
As yuh guys were told last week, those PCs might not be enough so you're advised to come along with your personal laptop if yuh have it.
Then lastly, please, practice evrything, get used to coding websites, learn to program with simple programming languages like VB, then get used to math too, its not your enemy.
Btw, computational math loves yuh guys so so much
Yuh love it too 🙏🤝
Great work done bro♥︎

It's ohhk to make fun buh am out of this.
Naye mwe flow charts bilala

Anyway on a serious note my @256751706107 has withdrawn from the post ebyadala so group B members look for a new coordinator
Omukazzi ayina okunfumbila😂🫴
dont worry learning iz a process, it takes some time to grasp a certain concept, let me assure u that the more u give it time, the simpler it becomes, remember its like math which needs continuous practice
Naye prince 🤣 we r trying to be serious
lets not just come to final conclusion on this,
Ssubi don't

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Aisha Ssubi for her exceptional leadership as the Group B class coordinator over the past two weeks.
Despite the challenges that come with balancing personal responsibilities en academic pressures, Aisha has demonstrated remarkable dedication and flexibility in her role.
As she decides to quit, I kindly request all Group B members to attend the Monday lecture so that yuh  elect a permanent leader, as the position is now vacant. (YUH HAVE NO CLASS COORDINATOR)
Once again, thank you, Aisha, for your tireless efforts en commitment to our group's success.

Ohhhh is it a reality?!?!
Agambe akoowa😭
Lwaki ate nawee
I have a qn for the lady, is she really comfortable with this. I mean it's getting a little out of hand. Why not just inbox🤔
hmmmm
Bro you resemble the ppo's president 🥲
You are speaking 🤝 Some fun are out of social ethics and integrity
And I urge guys to stop that kind of fun with immediate effect
thats it, this fun should really be stopped
Truly asked bro
@256750529280 please man respect yourself as others do respect u
Incase u hav love issues with her we do request dat u take it in yo personal inboxes but not here bro👊
It’s just a request man but l see like yo just forcing yourself onto the gal 😂
Thanks Bruhv
Though I’m just perplexed as to what happened to my dearest friend Aisha
She quit on the coordinator role
I’m hurt
Was "forcing" really necessary😂
Wen you get into leadership, incorporate her ☺️. She has her reasons so talk to her
She just wants to live a normal campus life like the rest of us, coordination isn't it
Man it looks weird to kip on tagging de sem person everyday but she doesn’t reply u
Moreover on a public platform
nkugamba
All needed in here is open communication without singling or tagging someone. We all perceive things differently.
I submit
Atleast in the inbox
U can bare with the blue ticks from the GCA (Girl Child Association)
Just meet the lady in person and present your manifesto
Dats it 👊
Pipo are bad😭😭😭
Don't dare cancel the Paris wedding bro
They have said am "forcing"😭😭😭
but some communications here are really never filtered to be tagged, this is a public platform, but some continue putting things which dont need 2 be put here
You are being insensitive bro, enough is ENOUGH ⚠️
🤝
haha
@256750529280 we a all boys
But yo style walayi we do abuse it here
Yo putting us down
😭
Okay guess we should respect her decision
Yeah man
hmmmm, let guy man up
THATS A point bro
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Let's try to be respectful in all means 😂🫴
The wise keeps silence
How can yuh convince us to be respectful, respect yuh or even try to respect the platform if yuh  have failed to do the simple thing like respecting yourself....???
Correct 😂🤝
Uh Uh...
He's a student, let him stay
@256751706107 jangu ontaase😂😂
SSUUBI where a u .coz all I see z dat u a the only to make this group clear..
banange muve ku ssuubi
She is of no need here
De boy is the spy in ha life
Just forcing connections to her
The message reached the owner so you deleted it😊 🤝
What if they know each other why do u think @suubi z quite on t
Respectfully
Bad things pipo are not asking  themselves why ssuubi aint replying 😂🫴
Anyway weekend we move😂
haha vj @256701448552 in action
Everyone is trying to fight @256751706107 's imaginary battles but one thing I know if she's irritated by @256750529280 's continuous taggings she would've said so, let's not go ahead of ourselves and keep calm
📢💨📢
BTW, this group has other members who are not of DCS buh am disappointed on how we represent ourselves.
My goal was to produce a guild president from DCS cause we have capable people like @256742169258, @256760780703 en many more buh we are killing this from the roots.
I beg we jhus step-up the game en all will be great.
Charity begins at home
📢💨📢
Good morning folks
Whoever feels above other people's opinions will be denied the right of freedom of speech.
You will be part of the groups that only admins can share informations so that you're not left with any vital academic information
So let's filter and weigh our messages before we submit them in here.
Thanks
DCS is the biggest and apparently the lead program, and a lot is expected from us, we can't continue entertaining submissions that will be poisoning constructive discussions that must be taking place here
Thanks <This message was edited>
Are u free we go ko ku ka KFC kuba 😌🤝
Btw guys i have a question
Can u vote me for guild??😌
Eza KFC ziteeke Ku my Airtel😁
I agree with u,,,,so members bigup
Tokikola bro😂😂
@256782470261 I gat a suggestion, y cant this grup be limited to ONLY ADMIN CAN SEND MESSAGES for this weekend then it is opened bak on Monday koz some pipol here are just never listening
This group is purposely meant to allow us communicate among our selves.
So pipo didn't see this
Tell me so that I don't wast my time guys😭😭😭
That's too personal
ok
Anyone called Viola in here, I’m urgently looking for you please
@256740750431
🙏
But it's we to regulate the contents we are receiving and submitting.
For now, I stop here.
Nice weekend guys
likewise sir
Is dis grup for DCS interaction or mainly studies
Plizz keep me updated I might be on the wrong track
READ THE GROUP DESCRIPTION, it gat everything
Interactions, that's why the other groups were limited to only admins sending messages and this one left free to everyone...so the administrators should clarify on what we post here.
But why are u very wise😂🤝
More kfc for u😂
Ssubi tz early to quit plz am begging remain their let words dont drive u out
null
My mobile money is open and free to everyone, just like this group😂
Mukulu nyanzi oli musajja mugezzi 😂😂

How can't I know it Sir
Oli musajja wamanyi😂
Who are the administrators?🙃
I can only vote you or you 😉😉😉
Man just know Suubi is not well with this, stop this kind of simping. Go and just talk to her verbally
Olinamu ku 3M ku account yo ezitakuluma, we shall start from there
Why is fearing to talk with her verbally don't fear tell her she may accept man stand strong
And for you where do you stand in her life to say that or you also pursuing her 🤔
Sure🤗
That topic was adjourned until further notice 🤝
Well, if am also pursuing her am much sure she's not well
I thought like something of 10M😭
Ehh😂🙌
I said 3m for the start, quote me well.
😂😂 i think you know her so well i rest my case  and by the looks of it you know her pocket size 🙆🏾‍♂️
Plus her accounts balance as well
I also said I thought 10M for the start quote me well😂🫴
Lemme guess you are the best friend on the sideline in pretence....... i think you should commit before its late
Continue guessing until you guess the right thing 😅🤌🏽
@256750529280 hope you see why the guy is scared and attaching limitations of money trying to portray himself  like a millionaire 😂😂 even those with money their women are taken 😂
😂😂😂😂
Facts 🤝
😅Man am not trying to portray as a millionaire,  quote me right I come from a humble background
Naye u like to be quoted right 😂🙌
So when I said that do you have 3M for the start,  you guys thought am a millionaire
@256775379793 🌚
Wamma u not a millionaire
But I will be
Don't forget the Insha Allah 🤗
We all wish u well bro
I will be a millionaire INSHALLAH 😊
Fyi quoting humble background doesnt mean poverty its just that when you attached a monetary value onto someone it exposes your weaknesses like am pretty sure you cant approach her because you think you need 3M minimum to move on with her because am also from a humble background😂😂
Thats nyc now 😌
I aslo pray that you bcome one
The context of the 3M wasn't about Suubi, it was about Prince saying he wants to be a Guild president, can't even spend 100k on her that's reality <This message was edited>
😂😂 bro eeh 🙆🏾‍♂️
And am sure from yesterday's teaching  in Juma sermon even you @256750529280 you can't spend it😅😅 <This message was edited>
The khatwib said "girlfriends"

Why can't you😂

Yesss, is she your wife then😅😅

Good morning folks, 😀 😊 and happy Sunday to you all!
As we conclude the weekend, I am requesting group A members who have not yet submitted to me their discussion group members to do the needful as soon as this information reaches you.
The list of the group members are needed by our lecturers for their assessment purposes
Thanks 🙏
Oukey and I would also like to inquire if those of ground B are been requested for!
Yes, @256703094704 have been requesting for this since Wednesday
```Ahab -1 wife
Herod - 1 wife
Ananias - 1 wife
Pontius Pilate - 1 wife
Jeroboam - 1 wife
Nebuchadnezzar-1 wife
Haman - 1 wife
Zakayo - 1 wife
.... And they all lost their way and betrayed God.😳🙄
Abraham - 3 wives
Jacob - 4 wives
David - 4 wives
Solomon - 700 wives
Rehoboam - 18 wives
Abijah -14 wives
Elkanah -2 wives
Lemech - 2 wives
... And they all found favour in the eyes of the Lord🤔
Whatever you do with this Information is non of my business. 😎```
Where do u fall
This is the reason why God granted Solomon as the wisest man
😂😂😂
That's the fact, just know managing that number of women deserved him that
Be warned, they  finally led him away from God. <This message was edited>
The love for women cozed David's family strife.
We don't want the family we only need David
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oyogede blood
His son wanted his Life. He lived a life of rebel once again. Not in the palace but in the wilderness
To make matters worse the kid chewed his stepmothers at a roof top and he forced the nation of Israel of Israel to witness
God punished David. And thats wat He does to those He loves
Good evening 🌞

This happened in his old age he enjoyed the youth
It was his thirst for ladies that pushed him to the extent of killing one of his men so that he could have the wife.  The moment that happened prob ko prob until he died
Okumanya it was a lesson, towards the end of his life, they got him a la babe to keep warm. He only used her as a blanki and nothing more or less
She was like a doll, a teddy bear for that🥲
That lady gave him the nxt kimg
But he lost the first child with her. It was all God's mercy WIC He still pours unto us today. He used a sinner. From the line of a sinner he brought us a savior
Bro u still gat alot to learn
You can imagine that one of Jesus' foremothers was a prostitute 😳, his ancestor Judas enjoyed his son's wife
Yeah, 😌. The salvation story is a beautiful one. And so large. There's a lot more to explore

Welcome to our third week of lectures.
Group A members should head to the DH for computer programming lectures
Thanks
Then group B
Where are GROUP B guys??
*SENTENCED TO DEATH BECAUSE OF ONE MINUTE CALL FROM HIS PHONE BY A STRANGER.*
A stranger comes to you and say help me with only one minute call from your phone, my phone is dead and i need to call someone urgently, and you, being a nice person, you say no problem, take and make the call.
Do you know what you have done? If your phone is used to call someone they want to go and kill or someone they just poisoned and when investigation starts and they had to check who called them last and your number shows up….
Let me break down what will happen to you so that you will learn something today from this platform.
First of all, you will be arrested for whatever crime because your phone was used to make that call and it will be considered that you know the person that’s why you gave the person your phone and it’s a known deal between both of you.
Secondly, since the inception of NIN, your phone is now your personal property that you will answer for anything that happens on it or through it.
So, for these reasons, you will be arrested and kept in detention until all investigations are
completed.
even if the investigation takes 6 months or two 2 years, that means you will be locked up for that period of time over the fact that you just borrowed someone your phone to make a one minute call.
Do you now see that your good heart that is void of carefulness can lead you to something so bad? *And ignorance (of the law) is not an excuse before the law.*
Don’t be stingy with this information i just passed to you. Share it with your family and friends so they can learn from this. If anything like this happens to them, you will be guilty of hiding this information .

1. *Proper Subset*: A subset that is not equal to the original set.
Symbol: ⊂
Example: A ⊂ B (A is a proper subset of B)
1. *Improper Subset*: A subset that is equal to the original set.
Symbol: ⊆
Example: A ⊆ B (A is an improper subset of B, i.e., A = B)
1. *Superset*: A set that contains another set as a subset.
Symbol: ⊃
Example: B ⊃ A (B is a superset of A)
1. *Power Set*: The set of all possible subsets of a set.
Symbol: ℘(A) or 2^A
Example: ℘(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}, ...}
1. *Empty Set*: A set with no elements.
Symbol: ∅
*Other Symbols:*
1. *Union*: The combination of two or more sets.
Symbol: ∪
Example: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
1. *Intersection*: The common elements of two or more sets.
Symbol: ∩
Example: A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
1. *Difference*: The elements in one set but not another.
Symbol: \ or ∖
Example: A \ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}
1. *Complement*: The elements not in a set.
Symbol: A^c or A'
Example: A^c = {x | x ∉ A}
*Notations:*
1. |A| or #A: Cardinality (number of elements) of set A
2. A ⊄ B: A is not a subset of B
3. A ⊅ B: A is not a superset of B
These symbols and notations are fundamental to set theory and are used extensively in mathematics, computer science, and logic.
Would you like to explore more about set theory or related topics?

Hmm 🤔
Actually to be sincerely honest in my humble point of view without being sentimental in my opinion and of course without offending anyone who ideally thinks different and without lies to the actual truth to the best of my knowledge with a clear open mind and a clean heart, expressing interest whatever is embedded inside for a long time which I didn't say because I was nervous. But today by gathering all the courage ,enthusiasm and motivation , I just want to say that I actually feel and think that I have to let you know that I absolutely completely have nothing to say🤗🤗🥹

*Hello coordinators, good evening.*
*Please let me know if all the discussion groups are ready so that we can present them to the lecturers*
```Note:``` _Each group should have a maximum of 4-5 people buh not less than 3_
Cc. @256782470261
Cc. @256777962860
Cc. @256705754496
_Thanks_
📢💨📢
*I have been told that the fundamentals lecturer told yuh guys to make groups of 10 buh, kindly, give me today's night as i talk to her so that she allows us to use the same groups we created other than mixing up*
_Thanks_ <This message was edited>
Good idea
For sure,,it's the best idea
Nah we want kavuyo
📌
Gwe nkumanyi, awo tosukawo. But I side with you bro😅
Stop acting like arsenal fans
Sebo don't put Arsenal in your things😒
Gwe ki man u fan kilabe
Nanti they are the only unserious people
📢💨📢
*I hate dealing with NOISE all the time, do yuh guys want all lecturers to consider the created groups of 5 or yuh want to go ahead en create new groups..??*
POLL:
CONSIDER FIRST GROUPS OR...??
OPTION: CONSIDER THE GROUPS OF 5 (19 votes)
OPTION: CREATE NEW GROUPS OF 10 (8 votes)
Wama,,,we should just move on with these created groups please🙏
Blax let's move on with the already created groups please to avoid being confused and disorganized
Exactly wamaa
Yes
So now what exactly will confuse you Simon? <This message was edited>
Now what's wrong if we just move on with the already created groups ? I thinks doing something once is better
Now like some groups are far with discussions!!! Imagine joining a group even you don't know the starting point ☝️
Exactly...so am kindly requesting that we move with the already created groups
No kavuyo 😂
📢💨📢
*Thing is too simple, why being so cool with people. If someone is not serious in the group, either let them be or eliminate them from your group.*
Mind you, if these groups are to be considered during the course work assigning, then every member will have to present personally when it comes to course work presentations. This makes a neutral ground for y'all. If you're not serious, then know you're digging your own heaven to failure...🤌📌
I support you bro 🤝🤝
That's y I love you 👍u always find a solution
Thanks 👍 for being open
Otyo
📢💨📢
*FINAL SAY BOUT THE GROUPS.*
_All the groups are staying as created earlier except for FUNDAMENTALS_
*Since we had groups of 5 created before, 2 different groups are to be merged to make a group of 10 people instead of creating other groups*
*This is to speed up the course work processing when it comes to group presentations since the groups will be few in number.*
*REQUEST:* Let group leaders choose the groups their to collaborate with en send in the group names to the class coordinators for example, GROUP 1 should join GROUP 2 to make one single group
*Please submit in the merged groups to your class coordinators*
_Thanks_
I donno anyone in the group they put me in🥺

🤝🤝🤝
Prepare your kanzu or suit,  as soon as you arrive at the venue go straight to the  MC and pretend you are talking to him something important,  it will help to drag people's attention hence thinking you are one of the organizers.  Then proceed and look for a seat strategically located near the food serving points.
Thank me later.

Good evening here
In groups or individually?
You must have your individual copy as well
What you will submit is your individual copy
The purpose of the group is to discuss and come up with a general agreement on the matter on table
Huh??💀
Mark it well
You mean all of we submit the same work in our groups ?
You can express yours differently, solong as it talks about the same point
Aight
Soft copy ????
Yes
Ok tganks
So the soft copy is it in Word or Power Point?
It must be in NETFLIX format sir
🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
This level of violence
It must be in HD format 😎
Is there any problem if people in one group the[ ten members ]present the same work,please advice accordingly
But u pple is this lecturer done with flow charts seriously
The purpose of the group is to make sure we understand into details the subject content
Mazima
But our individual submissions can vary
Yeah ✅
Okay, 👍
Such violence makes me happy
How are we going to submit the flow chart
The flowchart is done now
Which flowchart now😭😭r there assignments idk abt

*Good morning folks, this is a simple change in conduct en I request yuh to abide with it. I know of some fellers in here who are not jhus students buh also employees, hustlers or even self-employed en they might need support from us too buh they can’t go to one single person at a time trying to tell them what exactly they do. But, let’s try to make things look simpler, since the whole class is now group en we have other main groups for each group (A &B) for academic communications en school affairs, I kindly take this opportunity to allow everyone with a business that he/she would like us to support them in to be sharing their content here.*
Real support starts with us who know yuh en then spread it to the world.
I then kindly request the rest of the team to welcome them en support them.
Nothing beats love, let’s love en support each other because we all live cause of love.
Have a great day ahead of y’all. Stay safe en be blessed.
Love y’all
Seconded 🤝
Thank you 🙏🙏

Be ready to get ashamed after the game
I bet you gona be defeated
Bukayo Saka in the Champions League at The Emirates:
◾️ Six matches
◾️ Five goals
◾️ Three assists
🌟 Generate an algorithm to predict his performance tonight and draw a flow chart
That computes the match result
He is the first  player to make five consecutive assists from the start of the season to week 6 in EPL <This message was edited>
And he's just wonderful 👍
The computer is lyk there is an error somewhere
Remember GIGO
Computers are accurate but errors are due to users
Nze course work nawaniseee
There's time for improvement. The beginning is always like that because it's believed that some people change program , so second semester will be 👍👍👍
So ur providing false information about saka in short terms
Anko campus is more than high school
Check your input
Maybe the coding was not correct
Embooko egenda kunyooka mu gulu😂😂😂
Haaaaaaaa, arsenal fans get fansider 4 ur selves
What for ?
Haaaa, that was just man's expectations on how Jesus Christ looked lyk but not the true pick of Jesus ,,,,,okay
I mean the cross symbol, is in your meme...but no worries for you dont even repent 😂😄
I am a low thinker who takes much tym and I don't easily forget,humble ur selves and we pray,oooh God forgive these human beings coz they think they don't know wat they are doing but in normal senses they know wat is right,forgive them in whatever things they have gone astray today,Amen
But Gulu is on planet earth
Am allergic to low thinkers, cmon mate how do u declare yourself that
Read the luganda you man 😂😂..hope its not the low thinking kicking in to try n defend a wrong
Do u know zat there are many Northern students who write better Luganda than u,
@256779025158
Kati style ki
Yo young
There's no mentality of winning when you want,  you either win or you lose.
Football is a simple game 💪✌️
Ehhh👀
Tell them 👊
Boys are bad
Well for I conveyed a message to you in luganda...just glad you understood, u said a prayer...my parameters were the Christianity symbol [Cross] being used in your meme. Its not about my luganda grammar, sp, punctuation
With due respect as a believer, classmate...i mean no further arguments..
Its out of conscience that you do that to the same person you pray to.
Mukikuba, naye munansobola
Just pray we meet
Make sure you don’t forget @256782470261
Huh
Good night
Fine the person used it but I prayed to God to 4gve him  and I know God is very merciful but ur creating issues to come at the peak, y shud u do so?

That's fine, I was wondering how can we hv lectures on sunday
I think that message was supposed to be for yesterday not today
Which is okay
I am not seeing business skills on HP life
It's called business communication
POLL:
On the video assignment, I was suggesting all of us to decide on whether we shall submit handwritten or printed copies for assessment
Just for the purpose of uniformity. So let's give out our opinions .
OPTION: Handwritten (39 votes)
OPTION: Typed and printed (26 votes)
Obuzibu mwogela late, nze I did effective presentations🤦‍♂️
But🤦‍♂️I thought they made it clear afterwards
Who did?????
@256782470261
📢💨📢
A student can do as many courses as he/she can but the one we need for assessment is Business Communication
That was at 8pm yesterday
That was 8pm on Friday
It's all cool, I'll just have both
Yeah
I had also begun with another course
Ela sibilaba
Alright
Bro there's a search bar
Click on communication..it will take u to those courses including business communication

Gwe we don't have money for typing. We have our hands
Use the poll
WIC pol
Here
But the lecturer was very clear... that we can either type and print or write so it's better everyone does what they are comfortable with...
U pple who have voted 4 printed work I don't know let's try cheating the votes so that work is handwritten coz I already finished mine
You're right 👍

No one will ever tell you that you have to do a test that have been uploaded to your LMS, you have been given individual login credentials so that you keep on checking the LMS at your convenience.
That is another virtual campus that you must check atleast every day for updates
Let me do it coz last tym I got 0.9
😂😂😂😂
Could someone enlighten me on this
Ekizibu tomanyi luzungu timose😂
That is an online test and it will be him to communicate whether he will have lectures with us tomorrow or not.

Good evening fellows,
This is to submit that I received certificates that are less than the total number of students, and some people submitted irrelevant certificates such as the Cisco certificates and other non specified ones, even after me clearly stating what is required in the group.
I would like to therefore request those who didn't submit in their certificates to do so before 11pm. Since I will be submitting at 11:30pm <This message was edited>
For those who have not handed in their course work (Report)plse do so tomorrow morning ..may you all have a good night sleep

Here's a clear differentiation between present, gift, reward, and prize:
*Present*
1. Given voluntarily, without expectation of return.
2. Typically for special occasions (birthdays, holidays).
3. Symbolizes thoughtfulness, appreciation, or affection.
4. Can be tangible or intangible (e.g., experience).
5. Focus: Show love, care, or friendship.
Example: "I got you a beautiful scarf for your birthday."
*Gift*
1. Similar to a present, but often more formal.
2. Can be given for achievements, milestones, or gestures.
3. May carry cultural or symbolic significance.
4. Tangible or intangible (e.g., donation in someone's name).
5. Focus: Express gratitude, respect, or admiration.
Example: "The company gifted employees a bonus for their hard work."
*Reward*
1. Given in recognition of effort, achievement, or behavior.
2. Often tied to specific goals, tasks, or performance.
3. Motivates desired actions or outcomes.
4. Can be tangible (e.g., money) or intangible (e.g., recognition).
5. Focus: Encourage, motivate, or acknowledge accomplishment.
Example: "The employee received a reward for meeting sales targets."
*Prize*
1. Awarded in competition or contest settings.
2. Recognizes exceptional achievement or skill.
3. Often carries prestige, honor, or distinction.
4. Typically tangible (e.g., trophy, medal).
5. Focus: Acknowledge excellence, superiority.
Example: "The team won the championship

Hey folks, it’s not a good evening as usual.
I am saddened to share that our fellow coursemate Kissule Julius has lost a grandmother who was a friend en a mother to him. She passed on at Mulago after a long bettle with illness.
I call upon y’all to come together to support Julius and his family during this difficult time. We shall be raising some help as a class tomorrow from whoever is willing to contribute to a condolence fund.
We pray by that her soul rests in PEACE 🙏🕊️❤️
Banange so sorry dear, may her soul rest in peace 😭

🌚😡
Nayeeeee
Yoo good evening here.
Current notes about communication.
And need some serious discussion about the specification we are wishing to go on with in our course.
Eg Data analyst, Developers, Network engineers and so 4th just ka career guidance
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣feel at home
Ethical hacker, data science engineer, system administrator, web development, software development,
So we a good to go basically which is which
The choice depends on your personal interests
And passions
Okay
So wen do u specify during degree or after degree
*My perspective* :  some people may not think of going for degrees . So after your diploma, you specialize in something. Then as u continue with degree and other higher levels, u get to cover a wider scope and specialize more
Correctly
Ur right
But currently in this industry we are heading in paper aren't priority though needed, skill matters ba brooo
To elaborate more ....
The diploma is jus meant to give you a starting point and you can start specializing by advancing for example if you want to do AI you go for python,Julia and tensorflow
But some degrees help you do this where you learn the general in first yr then specialize later
Yeah. That's it
Yeah. It's important to note that in this industry, your CV is much more heavy with some innovations
So it's important to get involved in some online training courses like CISCO Academy, such that the CV becomes heavy. Because it's gonna differentiate u from any other diploma holder. U will have a diploma plus some other certifications that are recognized and definitely u standout
Ur right
Have u know about reverse engineering.
Yeah , have some little ideas
Some good money there ba boss
Ok
Even this is good
Ok. I'm gonna enroll
Thanks
When u try understating this field, u realize that problem solving is the  no.1 key to greater innovations.
That's why we're having many Artificial Intelligence programs, and the creators of such are enjoying cool cash
I've also jus started it
Exactly 💯
Ok
I'm gonna get serious on it also
Take yo seriousness into yo inboxes
🤷
Hey there
It's another day for me (Kevin Nabadda) to humbly request you to please vote for me and share the link.

So if u want to join my group it doesn't matter the %of Ur efforts now . Send a "hi" in my inbox then I add u.
Once we are all set in the up coming "Developers group" I will be communicating and informing u about the Agenda for our group.
Am trying to look in the near future and I have big things for this group if u may ask any questions u must have joined the group. The days and nights I have been thinking about it am sure we are on the ryt truck .
So I kindly ask u to think about it and in box me for joining and inform u more about it . We still have time to join but in the near I want the members of this group to be acknowledged, looked 4 , consulted , admired and much more .
Tell a friend, remember a group can solve a problem. Further more remember I have thought about this for a month day and night.

Keep the DCS spirit alive!
Best regards,
Buule Kenneth

Use your brain before posting anything here 📌
Boss, am not going to argue with yuh at any point.
Yo posting here porn related pics en yuh think I will sit back en let yuh show us your dubious background.
Am removing yuh en yuh will do nothing bout it📌
Is typing 😂😂
I feel like removing him wouldn’t be the best idea rather than just condemn him and correct him so that maybe im future when he is in a different setting he would not repeat the same mistake . Im just saying tho, don’t mind me
@256703094704 forgive the man bro🙏
Sebbo put him back
It’s a matter of teaching him de right ting to be dan
Ondagiira nga ani…???
We seriously need actions from the admins @256751706107 @256782470261 @256705754496
This is not how yo supposed to treat others
Yiita ne principal
Ehh
Let him first reach any of our inbox
Add him to the group
You guys who are pressing @256703094704 to put him back can pass the information to him

Vaako😅
Vaako bakuwaana😅
This is bs nawe 😂 yes what he did we accept was wrong ! But then we have to learn than in any society we have people like that and eliminating them doesn’t actually solve anything rather than just correcting them 😂😮‍💨
Yonah yo a class leader here
I would request you to show out yo true leadership skills
Nudes are normal dats de truth
See your life 🤌🤌
This is a study group not a porno network group bro
Check the group info, it's not a porn hub bro, let him just be in the rest of the groups where he can't post such nonsense
Who has posted porn here sebbo
That’s your problem, yuh didn’t first see wat he posted b4 I came out buh your here making bold texts like I have offended you
Can't he respect the ladies in the house? And I will still say no to him, let him send it to individuals who want it
But u pipo l don’t understand u
Did he post porn or nudes or just a naked woman
Take away
According to your primary education, define the term “NUDE”
Sebbo l saw everything ad l hav it in my gallery
Then post it too en I remove yuh 📌📌
But this is not how leaders do their things......Mr.Yonah,, the man has learnt something,he won't again do it🤝
We shall not keep quiet 📢
That's the problem with ill mannered people
You send again for us who missed we see 💀😂
It’s understandable bro, buh however people are taking it for granted
It’s not a minor man
😂😂😂

You even have the guts to call your mate evil, its as if he has been preaching satanic words.
We are really slaves

Whom do u want to know
👊👊
But this violence should stop,,i like violence but this is too much😂
Hello everyone,
I hope you're all doing well. I want to remind everyone that our class WhatsApp group is governed by clear rules, and we must all abide by them. Posting inappropriate content, like nudes, is strictly prohibited. Recently, someone violated this rule, and unfortunately, some of you are showing support for this behavior while blaming Blax for removing the person from the group.
Please understand that Blax did his part by warning the individual, but despite the warnings, the behavior continued. We will not tolerate any actions that go against the group’s rules. Let's respect the guidelines and each other to maintain a healthy and positive space for all.
Thank you.
Alvin, it’s better yuh don’t push this to a personal level bro.
If yuh think that this group is only made of BOYS, then continue tagging me in this nonsense.
📌📌
A word is enough.
You really want him,,, I'm seeing signs 😂😂
Gwe muleke
We are captives of our own creations.  I don't care who's hurt but if you get exposed of your own thing gwe amanyi

Sebbo nze am not here for that
Am here cause u removed our friend from de group
Anti u see yo colors
Let everyone know yy did u delete it 😂
Waaaaaaaa me no fear anyone here bro
Alvin, man up….
If yuh support wat he did, then go to his dm en console him.
I tried warning him en yuh saw how he replied.
If yuh wanted to be a real concerned citizen, then yuh would have come out b4 this altercation en condemned him on wat he had done <This message was edited>
Naye alvin olina Kizibu ki….???
Have I deleted any message from yuh…??
Dat was my nxt step den u decided to remove him without me getting an opportunity of tagging him
😂😂😂
Sebbo u deleted de screenshot l sent here
What step….
The image had been posted 4mins before I deleted it, infact yuh had seen it. Whey didn’t yuh condemn him…??
Why dd yuh wait for me to take action…??
Cause l was still viewing it
Inbox me,I send it to you 😂
See, Alvin, am not talking to yuh as DCS student buh rather my brother.
If it was someone else, I wouldn’t be here pampering him
With due respect, get me out of this nonsense 📌🤝
😂😂😂 Naye u boy
Nigga let’s keep de brotherhood in our inbox
Here we all talk as students of DCS
Now cut the crap
And my say is dat put back our fellow student
Dats all
This is wat am talking about 👊👊
Respect man
We don’t need to be treated like kids here
Facts
Yes! This message makes a-lot of sense en I wish your the one who talked first, things might have ended.
Buh, if we continue ignoring such behaviors, who will talk bout them en how will they end Mr. Ssali…??
Let's leave all this stuff✅
Add back the guy
And the group goes back to its normal conditions,,thank you all🤝
You as an admin have the right to delete the nonsense one can post but not to react to insults because if the president was killing all those that mocked him how many would be alive?
Bro, I deleted it en condemned the boy buh, do yuh know how he replied…??
@256703094704 and @256782470261
Our only say is dat one of u should put back de guy they removed
0764048048
@256703094704  add this guy,, thanks
Okk tell us hw he replied......
At times you have to let go of such minor things as long as you know your worth just add him back
So let’s put all this argument aside, we need to be respectful in all we do.
DCS class has girls too, how do yuh think girls feel when yuh share nudes of a fellow woman..??
Yes we can defend our fellow brother buh never expect good from the evil en stop sugarcoating what’s wrong cause next time, the same person will circulate the nudes of your own sister or mother.
Thank yuh
So are you going to add him back
In my view
I haven’t seen any girl here complaining about the pic de guy posted
Did u see anyone saying anything???
Yonah Class Rep changed this group's settings to allow all members to add others to this group.
Yonah Class Rep changed this group's settings to allow only admins to add others to this group.
De truth is that how will you know dat it’s my sister or mother

ANOTHER *SAD NEWS IN KABALE MUNICIPAL* . What is this country turning into my people 😭😭😭😭😭
The Uganda  Police found three in heads in a student's bag last night around 10pm. A young man, about  20 years, with a large handbag, got into a taxi lastnight. The vigilant driver smelled a strong odor coming from the youngster's bag . The horrible smell made the driver to suspect something, who then used the headlight of his car to alert the police at
Kabale university check point,  but because of 50k  the police didn't even notice anything. When the driver arrived at the cps , he set off the alarm, held the young guy and alert the police to search the young man bag. Many people were afraid . One of the Police was shocked when he opened the young man's bag and found three heads in the young man's bag. After examination of the heads, it was found that the heads were well known. It was *Tecno* charger head,  *samsung* charger head and a *Itel* charger head 🤣🤣. I appreciate your efforts to read this.
You can continue what you were doing or sleeping

_Am not a saint en if yuh have been close to me, I remember telling yuh that am only waiting for hell, cause I  have not perfect too. Buh let evil be evil en let the evil be blamed. Someone will not do something stupid, en we sit back cause his a fellow boy. Guys, this group consists of girls too en we have female class leaders for a reason. How would it look for a girl seeing a woman’s private parts posted in a study group…???_
*After removing the nude that the boy had posted, I only sent a simple message asking everyone to be vigilant on wat they send in the group  en guess wat, the boy came out saying that “I have no brains”. Was that called for…??*
I went ahead en talked to the boy personally en asked him to be careful when sharing media in the study groups again despite what he had replied me buh to my surprise, there some fellows trying so hard to get a word out of me, smthin I wouldn’t like cause however much your my friend, I will always take the right thing en yuh can hate me for the right thing I took.
In conclusion, this is a free world en y’all allowed to do what yuh want for as long as yuh don’t offend others. Learn to live with people en seek guidance before supporting some things. Remember, yuh got your admission alone, your to sit your examinations alone en if your to fail, yuh will fail alone as “YONAH, ALVIN or AISHA”…. They will not combine names that “ALVIN is a friend to BLAX so, let’s fail them. (MANYA E’NAKU YO)
Success in the tests guys. Know I believe in yuh en your to make it fully.
Love y’all 🙏❤️
I didn't know
Thanks man but we gonna rock it in the tests
I told u ad am still telling you dis now
Remove our friendship and brotherhood from this matter
We are all students in this group so dat ting of mbu friends doesn’t work here man
Okitegera
Your totally looking for smthin from me en yuh later start looking for sympathy.
If yuh have not understood, please read that message again. It has 3 different phrases addressing 3 different groups of people not yuh as a person
It’s ok, yuh can reply tomorrow after understanding it cause am not surprised by your speed of understanding.
Guys reconcile if there is any bothering matter
This is the problem some pipo have
So wic something am l aiming for from u 😂😂 in this statement
This guy must be wanting to hear smthin from me buh @256701448552, I will not change my word. I respected yuh as brother buh your exceeding your limits.
I told u to remove dat word “brother” in this group
Yo being a moron in this whole matter.
Defending stupid things. Trust me Alvin, even your own head is disappointed in you
What are you up to mr Alvin
Me l don’t care about all de words yo gonna use at me
But de only ting I want u to do is to put back our fellow
Blax is in dialogue with Valentine to bridge him back to the group but it seems you have your own instincts on as far as the situation is concerned
*ALVIN must SHINE*
🐿 😂🎉
You're over doing the shining gentleman and to my dismey, it's not in the right avenue
Man don’t put in de personal feelings into this matter
Let’s talk as fellows of de sem course who are yet to sit down for de coming tests
Can't some one remove the already submitted work 4rn the e learning and then resubmit
@256701448552 the will remove you too 😂😂😂
They can't
Why
No one has the permission to do so, he's sharing his opinions 😅
Well, we have understood. It will be okay
Gwe mwana mean business naawe

That one should be careful too 😂
U will make me  to violate u too
Give him room to do that, you're not the only one feeling the guy's absence
Go to the market
Me too
Yo not feeling it cause u supported him in doing it
Scarcity mentality Bambi, he knows that business is only in the market, I think the only gift 4 him is to provide him a  dictionary, so that he practices eng....
You help him out then
Simple
I know you well
No time for you
U also mind yo words man
U think writing here yo paragraphs puts sense in yo head
Withdraw
Alvin the greatest offense i will not tolerate is to stand me in support of nonsense.
Any right thinking person won't say @256703094704 did wrong by removing that guy even after trying to make him know his mistake.
Let him talk bro,, he's showing us what he has in the head...
Nze wat l know is that sam pipo are gonna hate me for all this cz sam hav already showed it to me
Naye my say won’t change no matter wat....
Guys have l made any fun about @256782470261?????
Seriously man...so dats yo say now
Alvin, stop saying that some people. No one is hating on yuh.
Count me out of the people who can hate yuh cause of your reasoning. I have known yuh for years now en I am not surprised.
I will still call yuh en talk to yuh where its due, correct yuh en laugh with yuh sebo.
So please, don’t get emotional boy
Sai... did l say dat yo gonna hate me now

Lecturer akulaba💀
haha, naye abiyagala
How can yonah give something fake
What's the say on this.
#conclusion
Which is which. Not stamped
as stated in the notice above
We need to verify the authenticity of the letter by stamping it
I support you! Otherwise I am smelling a counterfeit
so u want to tell us that the above notice seems not authentic to u, in short words fake?
ok, u may contact the AR's office 2moro
and inform us accordingly
However even the one of the Guild is not stamped! So which is which?
the bad thing ur nobody
haha
I have a question please.
Was your admission stamped ???
haha, ask him
e didn't mean u, we have someone on this grup called Mr. nobody he is the one being meant
tell him , pipo just want to fight everyone
Thanks for your justification! Otherwise you were going to suffer repercussion of  the notion
thats y wen u go 2 prisons, u find that some pipo inside are there koz ov such shit
now can I suffer because of some1 who does not think twice before acting
May you not poke your nose in matters external. Kindly keep your boundaries on your haunches. I beg you dear🤲
u deserve a nobel peace prize award for that mr
?!?
calm down, just ignore and move on with wat can move us forward, arguments and fights wont solve anything here
Am proud of you 💪😂
I wonder why some people think they can scare everyone
Eno ensi eyagala mirembe
yah, indeed, we really need 2 preach peace and love 4 all, thats the key to progress, without the two, we are doomed to shame and backwardness
That's it
This is a class group and it's shameful when people want battles  all the time
We really need to style up. And act maturely, (or pretend to be mature )
Wama we need to settle and we revise our behavior, let's use this tym be4 doing the papers, for those who can't atleast behave maturely let's pretend as he said, we need mentorship ,,,, y not
Does maturity give you bachelors
Let talk about 2morrz lectures,,,,,, {those who want nonsense I request admin to open up a group for u}
Let everyone remain as he or she is,,,,why do you want to change people..... you think everyone likes maturity..we grew up in a world of fun.
Twareri maturity yo mu church
Remember everything is done from first principles .
U will no wat Jesus meant wen he was talking about lost sheep
That's why in class we're taught only right things.
We would be staying home and setting our own exams
I am yet to giv u pple the 7 habits of highly effective people
Hmm
Say whatever you want but you will never change people including me,if you like maturity,be with it and leave others to be.
How can you start advising your fellows as if you are above them..we are at the same level.
Everyone does what he or she likes📌
It's philosophical, give it time
So you are not grown up
Anyway let me leave you
I can't give you my time
COMMUNICATION SKILLS   .......*Applicability *
Comrade, kindly ignore such impunity and blasphemy. <This message was edited>

Go and ask AR

If Ur not gentle it doesn't mean others are not have respect and stop that arrogance

Easy bro

Mn I'ma pray for them everyday😂
We also pray for you
Awwww thank you
maybe that was sort ov  a punishment he was given, I think he did something wrong that made him be put off the grup
But @256782470261 seriously till now
This @256782470261 has no qualities of being a leader
He just goes with what's around
Our friend must be added back in the group 📌
But he is a schoolmate and coursemate..plus we all make mistakes but this is academics ..I feel like even if he did something wrong..he shouldn't be punished like this coz he is missing out on vital school info here <This message was edited>
point
@256742079658 ft @256709431540 ne @256779025158
I have now see de true pipo here who can put out their say in the light of truth
This is a serious issue that attracts attention....we all make mistakes,,we actually have a lecturer here...he can decide for us because it seems leaders here have totally refused to add our fellow
Nedda nedda don’t include in de lecturer
Let des fellows do wat they a supposed to do in its right way dan leading us like we are their kids
When I say something here,, admins run to my inbox trying to convince me instead of coming here and we sort out issues
😂😂😂
I thought they do it to me alone
But de only say is for them to put back our fellow den we end all dis
Yeah,,if we request something they should adhere because all he did wasn't good for us all but we forgave him and took it easy....but admins want to show that they are more concerned than we students <This message was edited>
Yeah,,, it's actually taking most of our attention and time,,singa kati we are in books😂
We a *Not requesting* but they hav to do it just de Way they did it before requesting us to do it
The problem is that they see messages but they can't reply,,,
U know wen de force act on u
U will always hide away from the nxt tym they show up
What did he /she do???
Regardless we need him/her back and we are giving a deadline 😕
We need leaders not rulers 🤌 <This message was edited>
haha, i respect yo word bro, big up
Actually we shall start applying force or we look for new leaders
You are good bro
So is it a he or she we are fighting for
Otherwise wat went wrong
He
He did wat
If case taken to the police and to the courts of law its a case 📍🔊🔊🔊
am also not in the know y that guy was suspended off this grup, but the suspension officials are like he misbehaved, i dont know even how
Nze munfuule admin I put him back and I do the same to one who did it
haha, bro keep that strong heart, it can even move a mountain down
What he did was normal
We youths and humans so u can't just be selfish and disgusting to that extent
Assume it were you( talking to the one who judged a fellow )😔 we all slide in our deeds sometimes
And no man is an island u can also be touched young king
Should we be demanding for political prisoners 😕 then students also <This message was edited>
I do advise you to tag dem in for all des actions they should put in place
Wulira ssudi 🤭
sii Saudi nawe, just tranna give u zeal hhaaha

😂😂😂😂
Imagine you have a big box of crayons that you love to color with every day. One day, you go to use your crayons, but they are all missing! You find out that a friend who was supposed to keep your crayons safe accidentally lost them. Now, you and all your friends who like to use your crayons are upset and some even find it a little funny. This is kind of like what happened with Microsoft 365, a tool many people use to work, when it stopped working because of a problem with another company called CrowdStrike.
(via ChatGPT) 😁
when you are favored by God , You are also favored by the devil, is coming for you.

Google Unveils SynthID: A Tool to Watermark AI-Generated Text for Authenticity
Read Full Update Here:
SynthID was announced last year August and started as a tool to imprint AI imagery in a way that humans can't visually decipher — but can be detected by the system. The approach is different from other aspiring watermarking protocol standards like C2PA, which adds cryptographic metadata to AI-generated content.

Look at this one
Yaa I have been lost for some good days am sorry fellow developers. Trust me am cooking something big
Sorry for wat?
Good afternoon here *Pls read n fwd it...*
A man was crying and someone asked him why he was crying. And he said I have only one son, I have done all my possible best to educate him so that he will be a great person and by God's grace he has been able *to acquire all certificates* including:
￼🌺 U.C.E
￼🌺 U.A.E.C
￼🌺 Bachelor's
￼🌺 MSc
￼🌺 Phd
*BUT*
Unfortunately *he fell sick* and doctors said they can't do anything about it and the only option is to die *in the next 30 minutes* and my son told me to bring all his certificates and I brought them. All he could say was;
*father, these are my degrees but you never told me to study my Bible*.
I don't know what I'm going to tell God.
*Note*:
Not all of us will share this message because it is not an interesting joke. But if you are courageous enough to share this message please do so and God Almighty will never forget what you have done for Him.
*PLEASE LET US TAKE NOTE OF THESE:*
￼🌹Study the Bible like the way you study your notes when it is exams time
￼🌹Fear God like the way you fear death or people in higher authority
￼🌹Remember God like you remember your name
￼🌹Pray like it is the only thing to do to go to heaven
￼🌹Fast on regular basis
￼🌹Have time for God
￼🌹Be the doer of the Word
*70% will not forward this message but I hope you will..*
Send this to all christians on your contact list in Jesus name.
*GOD RICHLY BLESS YOU.*
Find out this : *B. I. B. L.E.*
BIBLE simply means:  *_Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth!_* Did u know that
➰ *_When u carry_* *"the Bible"* Satan has a *head ache.*
➰ _When u open it_, he *collapses;*
➰When he sees u reading it; he loses his *strength, AND* ➰When u stand on the *_Word of_* *God*, Satan can't hurt u! Do u also know dat;
➰When u r about to forward this to others, the 😈 😈 (devil) will *discourage u*?
Pls

There is someone responsible going to contest for that position unlike u
𝑨𝒕𝒕𝒆 𝒚
If not him then who
𝑲𝒊𝒈𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒖
Responsible😢
Isn’t Uict a non party institute?🌚
Martin Tendo
Y not
Gwe guy UICT politics is not affiliated with political parties
𝑰 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒄𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒍𝒚
Our guy
I am a persuasive, strategic thinker with a deep understanding of political dynamics and a unique ability to unite diverse perspectives. I possess the resilience to navigate complex issues, the insight to anticipate challenges, and the empathy to inspire others toward meaningful change. My skills in communication, negotiation, and problem-solving empower me to advocate effectively for the needs and values of my community. With a commitment to integrity and inclusivity, I am ready to lead, listen, and act decisively to build a better future for all.
#For a better UICT
😢
Ur right he is
When did you think about being the guild president
I will be grateful if u mean them other than pasting that content from AI
We are recording
Tendo Martin: Says...
The way u love AI hmmm u might have used it to type this😂😂
Hahaha 🤣
But why do you take leadership for granted 🤔🤔🤔
Politics is in blood and when we talk about ability, i know i am able and suitable for the post. Back to your question, I thought about being the guild president of any higher institution that I could join since my S3 so when God brought me at UICT i realised that its my time
waaaaaa, he consulted mr Kamba for the english
Success bro
Ehh
It's good to have your dream ✨️
Just give him thirty minutes on  Monday  sit with him and tell him to re write it 😅😅
U can use any Ai checker if u want🌚
That can't be😂
That's if he shows up for lectures 😂
He must😅
Just wait and see..I know what I'm talking about 😂
I understand how it might seem that leadership is taken for granted, but I believe true leadership is a privilege and a responsibility, not an entitlement. Embracing leadership with humility, integrity, and a genuine desire to serve others is at the core of my values. I view leadership as an opportunity to make a positive impact, and I am committed to approaching it with gratitude, respect, and an openness to learn. By focusing on constructive action and empowering others, I hope to foster a space where negativity is replaced by collaboration and optimism, so together, we can work toward a shared vision of progress.
😂😂
Haha, embracing AI. I have an innovative plan about AI😅
Are you aiming at giving us some good information or you are trying to show us that you know many words in your head🥹😎
I said you can usse any Ai checker to see if i used any😌
I like your theory bro
It's obvious
You can don't loose hope
Write whatever you want,,,,,but inboxing is the major thing of all🤝
You seem to have alot of negativity and broad thinking, politically it's okay because its from you that will spread the gospel to others otherwise it would be a opne sided situation. All in all,  am looking forward to seeing you next in my cabinet
Thanks alot brother
Do you have money 💸💸💸
It's okay brother, whether ai or not, all am sighting is the guild position
Ku ground wafu😅
I realise the fact that i started this abit late, but with all your support fam, am strong and determined
The way prince is serious today am standing with him and l will support him as the next guild president
Money aint a problem
We don't need your manifest now,  we want to see strategy
Ok you can continue with your words,,,we shall get in touch
This is the spirit brother. Bravo!! Anyways, i call upon y'all to stand  with KIYIMBA SHARIF PRINCE on the post of guild president <This message was edited>
Alright brother

You want to bring 10 🫂 here why?
First look at ur self then after u will realize that ur chimpanzing🫣🫣
Who be that?
He is soon realizing
Let me help you send you something I heard that you didn't eat lunch
Can it happen 🤔🤔
You just rearrange your words starting with the second followed by the first then the third one remains in it position
It's called programming. Style up
However you call it the final statement will be "IT CAN HAPPEN "
current affairs
Mutoozi waffe yasalaawo
Continue
Again you are here
Tokkilizibwaa
That's not your affair you will make me leave for you the group my friend

Hmmm ok this is computer science ,only content not grammar
You hit it, we write codes on condition that it co-tows to syntax and semantics <This message was edited>
Look at u
Yo being taught communication skills every Friday but u will never learn de right grammar to use 😂
English grammar z for *English news reporters*
Does right grammar bring food on table?
Ok wat if English people also don't know English also
Consider 0>1 as they say
1 Mango

2 mangoes
So who z u nt having a distinction in English  atleast in consecutive levels

Wen u get a retake of communication u will understand de right format

Even me but am seeing in the timetable @256782470261 help us please 🙏

Say it again 🥲
Hehe. Anti via running
Ba boys muje wano

It's something small
But she can come and get some chapati only
Things I can buy for myself
I was going to sponsor the breakfast for her
Do u want cassava 😂
But some are going to ask next month which is starting in some hours from now
That's them

Ah you are very cheap like that?
That's cat 🐈 food 😎
Can you imagine dat bro 😂😂
Dis gal nedda nedda
And it's very nice
But I wish you sponsor today because for me I will not come to campus today
If you are expensive then where is the car you "drive" everyday to school

Members it seems @256709431540 came online for those offers posted
Mr violence 😢 💔
null
Those who know me know I don't deal with such... just wanted to jazz with u guys
It means u are becoming annoyed let me just stay offline
Kale kale
Everyone leave @256709431540 alone......🙈
Ok I have surrendered
This is the mindset most of you have😅😅🤌🏽
Thanks for your comment
Now u think ur superfly with ur rigid mind😒
Ur serious alone... that was a joke
But you were getting annoyed at the end
My people won't kill me with laughing 😂 🤣
You try staying 6feet down then you tell us how you feel
@256763126678 please let people rest. Who is your teacher of violence 😅
He was sacked the day 10 🫂 was also sacked
i feel like tagging someone
Who be that one?
null
That's our behaviour when we win
Is it because "you guys win when you want?" 😅😅😅
Waaaaa man utd fans over like talking,u try 2 copy our behaviours we Aston Villa fans
That's the reason
The bitter truth is that you are running away from your team
Waaaaa
Exactly
I know all Manchester United fans with there behaviours
null
null
Sometimes you make we laugh with the phone
As U paid t to pool and spurs
Yeah
Do U think U will beat any of big clubs this season
null
Cam well prepared in 25/26
Man U is gonna resume to it's old ways next season
Ever man u is like dat
Yeah
But Chelsea will expose it
I argue all man utd fans 2 begin supporting Aston Villa
@256779025158 did u find @256757677061
That fake team
Are u an Aston villa fan
He's a Man U fan
No
Right, he was once a Manu fan but don't worry things are going to work out next season
Is my fellow man utd fan
I wondered wen some one told me that she supports Brentford
The logic of GP is Boolean in computational math, haaaa things change
She's right
Whoever support man city, Aston villa and those upcoming teams is either a man utd or arsenal fan in hiding
Waaa,u just crammed that Ugandans support Arsenal or Man U,nae  it's not true
That's the reality
😂😂😂😂
Not at all how can someone support Fulham Brentford  Brighton and Nottingham Forrest? Maybe only against big teams
People who support those teams are our grandparents, and any agemate supporting them is simply seeking refuge after a serious heartbreak
Good morning here. Is the OOP TEST of DCS indicated tomorrow ours
Then @256744911033 is his grandfather's age mate
Thank you for your message. We're unavailable right now, but will respond as soon as possible.
Probably
But guys how are going to keep our phones during tests time
In our pockets

Ok
I think let's get smart watches and leave phones , so as to be more ⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️
I have a strategy, wen stranded, I will be moving my seat to make sound, or even throw the pen.
As long as u notice this, u help me substitute please
She is here outside
Mugambe ajje😅

No
3 4 3
This requires quick wingers
Attackers should be good 💯

To whom will I give my 4n ,do they provide storage facilities 4them anyway
nara
do u have any frendz residing in the skul hostel, u can tok with them they keep in their room and u pick it after

Does the administration respect the time set on the timetable or not ? We can’t be seated for a full hour and there’s nothing going on and no communication at all ! Can we please be informed whether the test will be given to us or we can go on and prepare for tomorrow! Dear class rep please help inquire for us
@256782470261 is there any information about the delay?
Gwe uncle njakujja nembooko kukube mugongo
null
The paper was supposed to be  started at 2 and end at 3,,,,so time for the paper is done I think
Exactly
As if we are in primary
The paper is for evening not afternoon
Man😔
I have realized these lecturers are making a formation wc will destroy our line up. Anti we have only one midfielder.🤔🤔🫣
Don't be stupid,,,,now is that maturity you always talk about..... what time is indicated on the timetable🥹🥺🥹
U should put into consideration the rain factor that distorted papers in the morning. So there's a backlog that has been in place, and according to me, I think it will come in late afternoon
Then completion, evening
But I think rain has no problem because papers that were scheduled in the morning are already done
Yes
So I don't see the reason as to why they are not bringing the paper,,we don't want to know whether it's hard or easy
But there was a backlog and the supervisors are also human
They have to first refresh
Incase they don't come by 3:30pm then we have no case ..it's their case
Exactly bro
🥹🥹🥹🥹
We and lecturers,who gets tired first?
Them
Because they are doing hectic work
Where do you come from?
But do these guys know tht we haven't had lunch 😭
S. Sudan
Did you attend p.8
Man,,,, I'm not here to abuse you or any form of violence,,,so
I was sharp and I skipped
😂😂🙌
Let's take it easy.
They're also human beings and perhaps the delay is aimed at benefiting is
I wonder if exams were done according to the first timetable some papers were going to be done at night,coz    it's more than expected
How can you delay for almost 2hrs and yet you are at your work place
I think the paper was hard and they had to change it
But hunger is killing me
Me too
How I wish they gave me 2 papers at once
Yes
That's wat u think,
Mwana😭😭😭😭😭😭let's send these lecturers messages that as they bring the paper then they should come over with our lunch
They're going to give us free marks
In apology for the delay
November being the only month which starts with "no" we have no food and no money
I even thought they provide refreshments, kindergarten Hooo,
Black November olemwa
Yes and someone yesterday said she can buy everything let's wait upto the 30th
Mbu the lecturers also haven't eaten,olemwa
💯
Eeeeh
Where's our freedom fighter @256702431529
But what I think we just need to move out. Bcs the paper is for one hour and starting at 2pm so it means that time as elapsed
🤣🤣🤣🤸🤸🤸🤸🤸
Gwe omusajja muveeko,
He said he will just send some one to help me to supervise today. Eraa olwemwa
But concern citizens won't accept
🤣🤣 freedom fighter....
His words have come to pass

If u had used  a significant and leadership username they will accept,but but but u use violence
Mbu the printer is down, oOoOO h

I'm still asking myself what's making them change the time,,,,, next time I think that they shouldn't indicate time because since we started there's no paper that we have started at it's appropriate time
I wonder why it was indicated at 11:am they would have put it at 2:00pm en we know it earlier
So the next TIME table they make shouldn’t have TIME on it ?😂
Oyagala tua test,
Exactly 💯✅
I kindly suggest that we do the paper now so that we finish it at around 1pm. Please
Talk about it 🥹.....
They should always just leave it open such that we know we plan to just come to campus full day and be there waiting for whichever paper comes around at any time
Eeh. So how shall we know that we are not right???

🚨🚨🚨RULES AGAINST SHARING OF PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENTS 🚨🚨🚨
Stay tuned 🦻🧏
Dropping soon from an administrator 📌
📌 Any one posting pornographic content is suspended for a week on first occasion. Next time , a month. Third time such person is refered to police for distributing pornography  contrary to section 23 Computer Misuse Act and section 13 of Anti Pornography Act. The sentence upon conviction is 10 years.
NB: Copied and pasted
Sir yes sir
This is how civilized groups operate. Note that it is criminal to create, distribute or even to be in possession of pornographic content. Read Section 23 Computer Misuse Act and Section 13 of the Anti Pornography Act. The sentences are harsh, 10 years imprisonment.
I will post the relevant laws here in a little while
🤝
Ok sir
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👆🏿
Yonah is it possible🤔if u arrange for an online lecture today cause most us🙏 aren't there today due the different factors🫡
I may not make it to the institute but you people have a lot of excel work to do

Aba TikTok challenge ndowooza nti you have heard🥲
Say it physically to them tomorrow 😂
They said pornography only ... leave tiktokrs to be
Those ain't porn contents
I was just saying 🫠
TikTok videos and marketing stuff shouldn't be here also ... this is an academic group 📌🔨
There's soft, hard and am forgetting the other 😅
Do we need a lecture on cyber offences? A brief that explains what amounts to an offence committed using a phone/computer?
Marketing is essential coz it partly contributes to academics.....

This coming Thursday we will present the second assignment. Each group should be set
Bro get serious
Absolutely
For only academic issues always wait on the other official groups...and it's not even a must that u tap into all the content on the group...u can as well filter wat u want to see that is of your interest.... otherwise let everyone enjoy wat they want here🫡...apart from the porn that has legal issues
This have not been seconded
What about those who don't have groups
We don't know the law .. though this can't make us innocent
So we kindly accept the lecture sir🫡
Fundamental presentation on Thursday .so be ready for it 👍.

In the age we walk in, there is porn all around
Yes, it's for those who didn't present

That's not logical she may take u as playing toy.
But if she meets I dde say that was what I was having in the account here is some 10k for the data
Haha and the other rule. If a gal asks u to buy 4 her data or airtime, bro she is broke and never tolerate with broke babes....
Do you think it is possible for me?

To ??
Do it
Haha waaa I know some men are weak hearted they can't go by their rules
But me I can go by it
Then Ur good to go brooo
Who wrote these rules 🤌
Basing on Ur statement Ur not a man....
You can also write yours depending on your nature
Stop advertising ur poverty man 😊
Opposite of poverty is rich .
Last time a certain girl said here that if u are rich you have to be driving a car upto school
Women are meant to be given 🌝
Just that we are in a generation weya boys are vele poor
So she meant we are all poor who don't drive..
Not having a car forbids you from providing data 🤌🤌🤌
Then what Shall u ever give her?
U crammed work seriously...... Women emancipation go revise
No but that man is trying to bring confusion here
So data on Ur side it's all u can give.
Men will always be men
Bwoba tomusobola muleke 😂😂😂
Many are ready to provide
You boys stop making noise here, real men used to go in wars at 20. See your lives now😅
It shouldn't be a big deal
It's minor 🤌🤌
Oyagala akusabe land title onyiige 😂😂

Even a diploma. It's all about what skills u've gained

Olye bya senkiyu
Now let me give these girls data to cut the argument short
My boys don't stress yourself
Abakazi tebasima...
My advice is that:
You start working on a specific skill. For example if coding or  programming, start learning a particular language now
Okyali mu error enkade

The Heart Talk
I expected this, but please give is an abstract of what tye channel is all about
just a moment
Welcome to "HEART TALK" the podcast where everyday people come together to share their real-life experiences with love in all its forms—romantic, familial, platonic, and self-love. In each episode, we dive deep into the realities of life, exploring how love shapes our journeys and influences our relationships.
Join us for heartfelt conversations with individuals from all walks of life as they candidly share their stories, struggles, and triumphs in navigating the complexities of connection. We discuss the intricacies of romantic relationships, the unique challenges of parenting, the bonds of friendship, and the essential journey of self-acceptance.
From navigating misunderstandings to celebrating moments of joy, "HEART TALK" offers a relatable space for deep discussions that resonate with the human experience. We tackle the tough topics—communication hurdles, emotional struggles, and the impact of life’s challenges—while highlighting the beauty and resilience of love.
Tune in to discover insights, find comfort in shared experiences, and unlock the secrets to healthier, more fulfilling connections. Because love, in all its forms, is a journey worth exploring, and together, we can learn to embrace its many realities.
I don't have any data to see that

Plz read this piece. Just takes 2 mins.
Medical Officers in the USA has sent this through to help each and everyone. Please read and take care of yourself - Dr. Okyere.
The rate at which  young people are suffering from Kidney disease is alarming. I am sharing a post which can help us.
Please read below:
IMPORTANT - KIDNEY DESERVES THE BEST.
Barely two (2) days ago, we all received the news of the demise of the Nigerian actor as a result of kidney disease.
ALSO OUR MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS, the Honorable Teko Lake is currently in the Hospital on life support with Kidney problems. I want to show you how to avert this menace of kidney disease.
*SO HERE ARE THE TOP 6 CAUSES OF KIDNEY DISEASE:*
1. Delaying going to a toilet. Keeping your urine in your bladder for too long is a bad idea. A full bladder can cause bladder damage. The urine that stays in the bladder multiplies bacteria quickly. Once the urine refluxes back to the ureter and kidneys, the toxic substances can result in kidney infections, then urinary tract infections, and then nephritis, and even uremia. When nature calls – do it as soon as possible.
2. Eating too much salt. You should eat no more than 5.8 grams of salt daily.
3. Eating too much meat. Too much protein in your diet is harmful for your kidneys. Protein digestion produces ammonia – a toxin that is very destructive to your kidneys. More meat equals more kidney damage.
4. Drinking too much caffeine. Caffeine is a component of many sodas and soft drinks. It raises your blood pressure and your kidneys start suffering. So you should cut down the amount of coke you drink daily.
5. Not drinking water. Our kidneys should be hydrated properly to perform their functions well. If we don’t drink enough, the toxins can start accumulating in the blood, as there isn’t enough fluid to drain them through the kidneys. Drink more than 10 glasses of water daily. There is an easy way to check if you are drinking
enough water: look at the colour of your urine; the lighter the colour, the better.
6. Late treatment . Treat all your health problems properly and have your health checked regularly. Let's help ourselves...God will protect you and your family from every disease this year.
(3) Avoid these Tablets, they are very dangerous:
* D-cold
* Vicks Action-500
* Actified
* Coldarin
* Cosome
* Nice
* Nimulid
* Cetrizet-D
They contain Phenyl Propanol-Amide, PPA which
causes Strokes & Are banned in USA.
Please, before deleting, HELP your friends by passing it..! It might help someone. Fwd to as many as u can.
WhatsApp is free, soo..frwrd it plz..please read and forward this.
Doctors in the United States have found new cancer in human beings, caused by Silver Nitro Oxide.
Whenever you buy recharge cards, don’t scratch with your nails, as it contains Silver Nitro Oxide coating and can cause skin cancer.
Share this message with your loved ones.
*Important Health Tips:*
1. Answer phone calls with the left ear.
2. Don't take your medicine with cold water....
3. Don't eat heavy meals after 5pm.
4. Drink more water in the morning, less at night.
5. Best sleeping time is from 10pm to 4 am.
6. Don’t lie down immediately after taking medicine or after meals.
7. When phone's battery is low to last bar, don't answer the phone, because the radiation is 1000 times stronger.
Can you forward this to people you care about?
I just did.
Kindness costs nothing But Knowledge is power...
Please send it to all your friends! _

_Do not save this message, send it now  the other groups that you belong to. _
_It is for your good and that of others, giving somebody relief is always rewarding.

Hello members of DCS, this is to remind you of our Christian Union handover.
I once or twice told you that that handover has a budget which we can't fund raise on our own. So we came to you as our neighbors to support us with any contribution you can offer.
For any of your financial support you can either meet Mulungi Esther the assistant class coordinator of Group A and I Marvin Arthur Ngabirano for Group B.
Only 9 days are on count down and everyone is invited on that day.
Even our lecturers in this group your contribution is highly appreciated.
This was the first podcast for yesterday and we go live in the next 5 minutes... please feel free to comment
We shall be sharing the link very soon
For those interested 👆
Ok
Good evening fellas

Hmm, oba Trump oba Kamala. Nothing will change.  Africans will be deported, they will still fund insecurities in Africa and Asia.
Let's focus on removing Mzee😅 <This message was edited>
But who is winning so far
_hmmm, haven't u heard mzee saying agenda pakalast, so u cant remove him_
Give it time, we are the change  man
_am hearing mbu kamala_
I like yo statement bro
But l won’t reply to it now
Let’s wait for 2026 on dat

_I know u want bobi, but lets just let mzzee be on throne until death separates him, tofayo he iz already aged_
Then Muhoozi
_oyo complete idiot nawe, he cant do anything_
But u understand that it's the military keeping Mzee in power
Headed by that mn
_anti he iz commander in chief, mzee has his law, he came by the gun and he will leave by the gun, so anyone who wanna remove mzee should come with his army too_
That drunkard is more dangerous than the dad, don't undermine him.  Guy has been in modern military 😅
_waaaa, wat modern military nawe, he even didn't go through training, he waz just put as a soldier koz ov the dad_
That's it exactly
But he will give up
Ehh, guy has been in war zone, he's a professional tank operator trained in Russia. A full tank crew man
Yeah
_simwesiga, if he is to be put in power, ADF and LDU will capture UG in no second_
But we shall launch cyber attacks into the system of Electoral Commission
No bro
See Burkina Faso, and Mali, they are now ruled by some young army men who they used to undermine
_ehhh u have already started planning for terror soundz_
Muhoozi is good at modern warfare. Ask those soldiers.
_but not a coward dranko like MK_
_my grandfather iz a soldier so he knows how dumb that nigga iz_
Yeah. No jokes
Just pray for an insecurity, the Mzee and his people can only go through an insecurity in the country otherwise in this situation we are captured
Exactly. Never joke with modern soldiers
_mzee already has his votes, dont u recall the census 2 months ago, thse are the votes_
Do u know what happens when a fool is given  a gun he can even do what is unexpected of him. Call him dumb but that dumb man can do something dangerous than an intelligent man
Ask him why Museveni' security is strong
🙏🔥
_dont u know that mzee iz a rebel(~ADUI IN ACTION~)_
Bajja kubuuza gyewabijja😅😅, onawulira
_mzee wange ali war veteran, so he will reply_
Kaale sebo, does he have any weapons, 2026 is near and we need to show Mzee something,   we need to make his bums unstable in state house

Not really
They missed one crucial step and that's why things failed
_lets think ov something else, we are IT specialists, lets get a cyber way o dethroning_
Yeah
Let's invade the system of Electoral Commission
_thats the number one project, who is gonna write the code for it, me I will debug_
Cyber way won't really work, Russia has the most Hackers , they have hacked different departments of American government. But have you had of any sort of Hacking in elections
We should send some spyware to the system
_hmmm, we should have computational thinking beyond Russia_
American response to cyber attacks is far miles away from Uganda'
_rajab and AI pro are the spykids we shall send them_
Just stand up, put in all you can. Cyber way will facilitate the struggle
Spyware will help us monitor their activity
_halleluyah, koz even biological and physical wars have refused_

Good morning friends
Now look at you
Omba when did it last win in premier league ???
Ask chatgpt
Ate Man U😅
Keep quiet!!!!
Shut up you
Man U is badly off
You know😅
We are not badly off but we want to book our place in the Championship early enough
We will come back in 2026/2027 season
Mediocre team,
Mediocre coach
😀😀😀😀😀
Man U 🙌🙌🙌
Get ready for retake because we will beat Arsenal then you see what Kamba will set
☕🤔🤔🤔🤔☕☕
How will u beat Arsenal
The way we did in 2004/2005 season
During the 2016-17 season, Donald Trump was made President of the United States of America, Chelsea went on to win the Premier League with an Italian Manager(Antonio Conte) in his debut Premier league season with Chelsea Football Club.
This season, Chelsea hired an Italian Manager (Enzo Maresca) and Donald Trump has just been made President of the United States of America. 😲
Chelsea fans, are you thinking what am thinking??? 🤔🙂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😂😂😂
It will be there's bro
Let's watch and see
Ok
They will win conference
Actually 😏
Gud mng to us all
As long as it's a trophy
Mikel Arteta , wats wrong, arsenal fans clarify, man u fans Arteta is likely to follow Ten hag
Nedda if you talk of Carlo Anchelotti I may accept
Waaa
Kiki kyootalaba
Do u think We're like man U to become coach traders
Man u fans were telling me mbu zea new coach is going to win premier league this season, depending on the performance of Arteta, just need prayers
Let them dream
We only want to go and win championship next season we can't afford that one
But arsenal fans is it appropriate for merino to start
Yeah, given the current situation
Yeah
We are going to win Europa then we go to champions league
See lies
But he knows the truth
Try your luck but answer this question "what's your position there now"
🤸🤸
For us we are only waiting for the time to be buried
We will assist in lifting the ⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
Oh Lord I come before you here I want you to brainwash everything about man utd from my head and load only the things concerning Barcelona
I pray you give me the way of regaining the money I lost in watching their matches so that I subscribe my TV again and I start watching only Barcelona because I can see Lewandoski, Raphina    and Lamine Yamal are ever scoring goals and not disappointing their fans but for us here BF, Zirkzee, Casemiro, Amad and some other players we wasted money on them are just doing for us nonsenses though Onana the Choir Master is trying in-between the post
I pray all this believing in your one and only son Jesus Christ
AMEN
🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
Amen
We are unbeaten in Europa
With how many points 😂😂😂😂
But we are unbeaten
i know with 3pts in 3games
Ask me after todays game
but we are talking before the game
Do you know that with the new format you can finish the group stage unbeaten then you fail to qualify? For the knockout stage
wisdom 🫡🫡
Wait today
Let him play the draw in all the 8 matches and he see is position
Amen......
Am now for Barcelona starting from now
U will be disappointed at the end
We should baptize you first

He has imposed danger on his group members
I saw him
Guys, let's learn to know the limits of our jazzes and the people we utter our words to recklessly.
Madam clearly explains the reasons as to why she doesn't make it for the presentations often but that human being chose to think he can comment in such a manner.
Let's not make our class be seen as one with bad reputations
I kindly submit 🙏
Even me the Noises Maker knows where to stop than some people here 🤣🤣🤣
just osbert of a guy,  is he in  A or B
He is in group B
And his behavior will cost him
You admins have a problem,, that group was closed for admins only.....now who opened it
Those official groups should be closed man....we are different people please 🙏
B
hopefully not in my group coz ww won't settle for him
Anti munaye someone said we admins think we must rule everywhere so we decided toet you guys be 😊in good faith
I admit that weakness sir
Buh this is gonna be worked upon 😊🙏
Btw...why was the group opened
Ssuubi that's the greatest offense you did on media
Truth must be told no offence caused the good thing now everyone has seen the reason as to why we had closed it
Exactly ssubi,,,, always limit us from those official groups
There must be a group including both students and lecturers and that for students only
That's why I love @256703094704
Isn't this group enough for our jazzes??? What else will the students want to text in that special podium that can't be shared in this general Pavilion???
So close those other groups,, and leave this open for all of us
i hear the guy is a member in my group but this should affect only him and i suggest it's time he starts practicing on how to write an apology letter to both madam and the he group members
But I kindly request madam to forgive our boy.Thanks🙏
Yaaaaa true
Why should it affect him... you should actually be with him in this trying moment because you are all one person right now since he's your group member
you guy , which trying moment. ..get serious
The blame should not be put on Suubi....we can't hold one accountable for someone else's irresponsibility,,,,it's not always a must to comment on anything,,,,, that's why we need to know our limits even when freedom of speech is due...
when h3 was texting,
did i contribute and the other thing i pay tuition alone with out his consent, so what are u telling me
A leader must always be strong in that pressure from public shouldn't change his/her decisions on a righteous realm
So why did madam Annet say that it will affect all of his group members,,,,,
We shall have this worked on, calm down
🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂
she just said but the culprit is known
it seems you are happy
Btw another thing,,,,why should you use your name or profile pic on a social media like this,,,,he should learn to use platform
Let him suffer the consequences,,,,nze muttade
Now like me,,,,who knows my name or face😂😂🙌
you know what yonah, i head that group
so i should be concerned
That alone won't stop you from being singled out, just have self responsibility and things will always be okay for you everywhere you go
Noted sir, reach ma inbox
But let all of you suffer,,, because how can you be in a group with such a person
Who are you please
You only hide when you're a wrong doer, if you're following the right footsteps,why should u hide your identity?
But anyway I acknowledge that we all have different priorities,tastes and preferences,,,,,I rest my case🫡
Because some of your contacts are in the offices there
Hahahaha,,that follow up😂
Maybe it's primary
And you also kept quite when the group was opened 😊you also knew the reason behind it😊you as a strong leader would have closed it again 😊before all this
Exactly 💯
But some have different contacts there
I see opening the group is the root cause of all this😊
But who are you honestly
Hi fool
Like due to your excessive knowledge and confidence please am requesting for your name
📢💨📢
*A lot is going to change from now on. The more you people are treated like grownups, it’s the more yuh prove to us being stupid accepting that your mature*
Yesterday but one, I talked to one member of group B asking him to be respectful to the lecturers since he had failed to respect himself en his colleagues buh I doubt whether he took it seriously.
Not even a week, en someone is trying to address another lecturer like his own kid.
I have always told yuh guys that respect is reciprocal buh yuh have never gotten to understand it either.
At time i feel like yuh people are the luckiest cause yuh even have a lecturer who is your best friend “@256702431529”. Thought yuh would do something thinking of how that lecturer would passive it.
You are here with your foolishness and yet we are in a difficult situation
Am not going to side with any student for whatever madam is planning to do cause every action has a consequence.
Always know that the bigger the action, the bigger the consequence.
I would advise y’all to stay silent en watch what’s to happen other than blaming any admin for opening the group cause am the one who opened it following the orders of one lecturer who emphasized everyone to have freedom of speech. Since yuh have violated that freedom with continuous evidence, then we have to close them again.
But that's not what madam is talking about
So you’re tryna say I’m the one who canceled
It’s clearly forwarded <This message was edited>
Trying reading this and understand,,,,, let's not just judge exactly..
So you all mean that we shouldn't joke or send anything in the group.....ok if he had replied madam,he would have a case to answer but I see he has no case since he wasn't replying to madam
I'm going to inbox madam and explain 😂😂🙌
Am following the conversation but truth be told here ad now
Sam of our admins don’t understand de people they are trying to lead....
The problem came from de admin who opened up de other group where lecturers are involved ad it gave a room to a few noise makers to enjoy it yet it was meant for only lecturers to speak in it
Thanks bro,,,,
Don't talk of Noise Makers because others are humble
Maybe you are the lecturer,,
You only miss the sun when it starts to snow ❄️@256702431529
Am not the lecturer but just bringing out basics of communication....
Atte don't attack me coz am sick😌🥹
@256751706107 hope u remember when l told u to close de group cause u a an admin there but u ddnt do it
But instead u were reporting to yo big boss 😂😂 @256703094704 about the first issue that happened there weya mr Kamba removes de other guy
Okitegera mwana cause now I see all de eyes are on u 👋
If we go in court,,,,,,the boy has no case
Let's try to be political
Hate or love me but the boy has no case
He should  again be added back in the group
We are all adults
Stop putting someone else’s unacceptable behavior onto
The person that gave you audience
Making the group public is no excuse
Language matters please stop acting like you all saints
Or there is someone to blame other than the person who used the freedom of speech  for granted
Anyway
Some of you are bored and just want to make a conversation that’s why you have a lot to say
Just mind your business please and go back to what you were doing before all this happened
(Like I said my opinion)
You just didn’t see it all please stop dwelling on half baked cake
The issue isn't about this comment...there was another rude comment that caused all this commotion
But it was very bad
😂 with due respect 😂
Check the wall
Nothing like joking here man , it has become real now whether he was joking or not
Let them two face each other,,,,

The recent missive is so labyrinthine and convoluted that it has left my mind in a state of cognitive dissonance.

You can also reach that level
It's a real head-scratcher, isn't it? The juxtaposition of the staccato rhythm and the melancholy mood is quite striking. Boat sinking?? 😕

What was good from there?
At least update us please
Everything
If i am going to be honest with you ,in my own humble opinion without being sentimental of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my own point of view,but also by looking into this matter in distinctive perspective ,i would like to say i have nothing to say.
Why?
Ur right
As earlier said if u don't have   a clear response to wat someone has asked please stay mute.....u don't have to reply to everything....
I come in peace ✌️

Guy, I don't  think most of the people who post pone to masters are unemployed.  Most of them are employed btw. All people I have seen going for masters in my circles have been employed already
That's it
Culprits are held personal because no one speaks for the other
Guess they will learn to respect hierarchy

Kindly note that I will not be available for class on account of the ongoing Augmented & Virtual Reality (AVR) training. We resume class next week.

Aaaaaaa aaaaahhh. We deserve respect.  Mukyilaba mutya?
It's a win for arsenal
Mulondo.....
Yes sir
Oyina yo mulondo?
Me as me
I don’t respect premier League teams
Yo too small to be in de big league For de big boys😂
Yes as usual
Defeats are now part of you🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🙈
Respect is given to those who win🤣
Currently every team wants to play arsenal
Hahaha 🤣😂
How did u know? Never play with a sleeping giant. Ok?
Arsenal now a failure
To enjoy the touches of arsenal
Haaaaa..the day is tomorrow sir
With no goal scored
*All premier League teams are small*
Even the big ones?
Which team do you support
No big one
Bro,, respect teams like Liverpool please
Now look at dis one
I would imagine there is always no champion. That would be so if all teams are small.
I do
Liverpool.has the highest number of champions league trophies in England
Am de champion of dis season
There are those that are small , smaller and others smallest 😀😀😀😀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝
A U sayin' once you meet Arsenal..it's always now a sure win 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Comparatively the smaller are bigger than the smallest. In essence declaring big teams. N'est ce par?
We shall bring Bournemouth again
Big up for those bu orphans. They had some kind of business with the Citizens and Aston Villa! <This message was edited>
Oui, c'est vrai. 🤜🤛
@256702431529 wats yo prediction wen yo team meets my team in champions league
Arsenal vs FC Barcelona
Hw do u see???
Who are de bu orphans
So are you trying to say arsenal is the smallest 😏
Barca is on song. My prayer is that we exit before we.meet them. Better that UEFA disqualifies them.
Bournemouth
We all know de truth but not forgetting manU as a junior team
@256777779815 u know de truth
When did man.united last lose please ???
I knew that this would end a Man U vs Arsenal.talk show. Kindly keep Man U out of this.
let man utd rest in peace <This message was edited>
Noted ... sir .. man u is still in the deadlock ... state ...
Talk show waz Abt Arsenal n big teams
In that case therefore....
First top four teams are small
5th to 16th placed teams are smaller
Last bottom teams are the smallest 😂😂😂
Hahahahaha l know dats every Arsenal fan prayer
But once in a while u should meet de big team ad have a talk on how they do it
No please. Giants only faulter. They will be up soon.
Amen
They need recovery ... at the moment
2 goals in 4 matches
Ask Real Madrid if they want a friendly match against Barca
They don’t wish for it cause they have fear for us
Definitely de answer is noo unless dey put a fixed game

Eish, wait n see. Under Anceloti I don't think so
Haaaaa
Bweyali ku Everton yakola woki ekitiisa😅
He is a good team manager
Like ten hag
Well said
Big up the guy won and is still winning trophies
Wea
In Madrid
So never compare ancelloti to guys like ten hag..ancelloti is or of the best managers worldwide
Wacha😅
Ancelloti is nothing bro
De only advantage he has is dat Real Madrid is a big team dats all
Pep is the king here
He has made history in all leagues Germany 🇩🇪 Spain 🇪🇸 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Just like Ronaldo did  in every league
So Ancelloti is nothing here
Except guardiola..which manger is better than him in premier league currently
Arteta...👀
null
Goodbye,,,never compare rodents to humans
Am not a premier league fan bro
So I only know Pep cause he was once my coach at home-CampNou

Young mn
What's it?
How are you
Am fine bro
But not the way I used to be
Why bro
The lecturer taught Group A and failed to attend to my Group 😂😂😂
Sorry for that
I also missed in A
And thought I would compensate in B, but all in vain
Whenever am very ready and serious for a lecture the lecturer usually disappoint me I don't know why
Me too.
And whenever rain comes, that's when he's always serious
🤣🤣
I'm going to write him a letter
Asking him why it's always that way 🤣
No don't do it
Ha you all done with the work that he has send for practice & the test online. don't worry yourself Wednesday is nearby
Guys am requesting our class condinators to at least tell the lecturer of computational maths to give us remedial tests on videos coz some of us we failed the 1st one coz we didn't know what to do
En i wish he do this especially especially when sending this current videos
Ok
Then what should I do ?
En it can be done for those who think they failed the 1st video
Ok thanks bro
Am ready for that because I got only 3
Out of 5
Yes
Yaaaa then let's our condinators try to inform the lecturer about it guys help with me coz even time caught me in the test even i don't how many i shall get
Mn u banged it
Why?
English 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
What's wrong in it?
Come i teach u American English
U scored above the average
Yeah but not how to admire nyash only
What of you?
Bad news
My paper got lost
Maybe you got less than 1 then the lecturer decided to keep it for record purpose
Not really bro
Why?
Handed in late and maybe it was misplaced.
Guys please let the condinators first tell the lecturer i know very Many people will pick interest in it
Even me I handed in 1 day after
That's all
The odds were not on my side
I will go and cry from his office 😂😂😂
But he will give us another one
Not really namwe
We need to tell @256782470261 to do that for us
If he gives it will be well
Else, I will go cry
Indeed
Mn these days ur a Brighton fan
Okay bro i think yona should be following us let him help us guys things are harsh
Absolutely
End is knocking the door
No amfor Barcelona but they welcome me with kiboko last weekend
Let me hope  ur going there won't affect the success of the team
Then bro let's take it serious i have liked the way you have picked interest in it
It will not but I went there because man utd had stressed me alot
Ok
It's high time man city fans go back to their clubs

Do U share parents with satan coz U a his vice wen t comes to lies
null
Bro I can't lie to you
Let me advise you. Stop it if u've been doing it. It's dangerous. Let me even share with you scriptures, from the Bible
Corinthians 6:18-20 (NIV) - Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
1 Thessalonians 4:3-7 (NIV) - "It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable.
This is so important for any youth .
Much as we joke here, but this should be at the back of our minds that God hates sexual immorality.
We should live in a way that honours God.
Because at the end we will be accountable for our deeds . 🙏🙏🙏🙏
We should live responsibly and sin free
Jah bless . Good night

Coz it's 2k to and from
And the return journey can be handled using TOEyota
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Jam is too much, I may reach when food is done
Am at kitintale now 😂😂😂
I've just reached Banda now.  But again the conductor has stopped to add in some people
@256786777193 what's happening on  ground. Should we proceed with the journey or terminate <This message was edited>
For me am at the gate of mubs I decided to foot from the junction at Bugolobi due to jam
I'm at spear motors bro
Am at the gate
I'm gonna pass through URA , then through MUBS and then reach
Bro hurry and book for two
The only problem is that these people at the gate is disturbing me too much
Bro let me send u principal's contact and u call. Tell him that ur going for lectures but have been denied access into campus
Send but they have made me squat down and babes are laughing at me saying noise Maker, noise Maker
Bro I've been arrested from MUBS . I wanted to use a shortcut through MUBS but was asked for the ID and lied that I left it home. Then the security asked me the  class I study from, I pointed at the canteen. Now I'm locked in a room
Bro we are having bad situations today but yours can be laughed 😅 🤣 😂 😆 😄 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro, just know the situation has become worse. and just know my cheeks have increased in size from slaps . The worst thing I did was to say that I'm doing ITB yet at MUBS it's not there. There's business computing.
Bro I know for ur case u can run away, please come and rescue me
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 mine these people are giving me on the knees only 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They have given me a female guard to escort me just know I will come and rescue you know because I will run
Bro let's endure. 🤣🤣😂
Everything has an end
👍👍👍👍👍
For me it's a man. And he's muscular, there's no way I can try to challenge him. Bro do u know for the first time this year I have cried
But the bad news is that MAN have finished food already 😕 😳 😢
I thought after this suffering food will wipe away our tears <This message was edited>
Ama get you guys sorted in Cafeteria tomorrow, something better than what  they had in the DH😎
Unfortunately they have put me in the vehicle which I haven't sat on since I was born the number plate is H4DF and I think escaping won't be easy now
Ok bro.
🫂🫂🫂🫂
Thanks. May God bless you
Bro ur case is different again. They're taking u to Kitalya or CMI safe house
You may unfortunately rest in peace ✌ 😔
You pray for me bro am in the bad condition
Now am from the frying pan into fire bro
Yeah
Bro do u know I've lost 2 teeth so far
My mouth is now empty bro if you are talking
My left ear has stopped functioning
Let me also laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro I can't feel my right leg, yet it's still attached
All my body is paining bro wait you will see from my status when they release me
My situation is out of hand. The guys are taking me to Mbuya barracks
Bro I'm in a short and no shirt. My eyes are big now, and I'm feeling warmth from the slaps
Then you will get me there am in now
I dressed like you now
Bro is the place too cold
Let me send u a pic of my escort, he's slapping me every time he feels like
When not in trouble you may find it cold but am finding the temperature higher than even the desert
Send in my inbox 📥 not here they may make your sticker 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆
Bro I'm finished.
Then it will be very hot
null
@256762364149 I hope you have seen the escort
Ok bro.
But this guy is well trained. He slapped me and I forgot my name, then he asked my name and I said Ten Hag. He kicked me and I saw pink sunlight
Bro are u still whole, coz that guy seems tough
He is very bad
Maybe he supports man utd 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro mine is enjoying slapping me.
null
Very tough I can't even see the eyes
Eeeh bro , do u know the guy is taking me on foot and P.7 leavers are laughing at me, saying "engineer ur looking good".
I will laugh at you when we meet here
@256762364149 mine told the driver something I have never heard then me direct into H4DF vehicl
Bro my lips are huge now. I think this guy has a metallic hand
Bro first ask him if there's supper
null
He said he is not the one who took me there 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Lwaki olimubbi
Then we're going to fast dry
Anyone who had seen @256786777193 tell him to bring for me the leftover here is very bad
One can get this dell latitude at 500k
But I have tagged one of the organisers maybe he will bring for us the leftover
I bet he has fainted😂 not on the way he was hypering the food
Do you know him?
But let him be careful. Coz he may join us
Then we be four
Bro we're at the first checkpoint, but the guys are speaking and I'm not getting any word
I told you before that you may fail to see me
Bro they've put me into a separate room, it has no light, no door, they pushed me through the window and my ear has fallen off
Bro let's pray because this pain is too much
Then your case is too bad but me they said I will go to military 🪖 court tomorrow
One is telling me that at 7pm the phone will not be in my hands
Bro they've poured a bucket of water on me and then said to me that you're welcome to the university of understanding
For me at 7:05 they're going to break it with a hammer
😭😭😭😭😭
Then be prepared to put on yellow
Bro they've given me a bucket and said that it's my new toilet
Bro I'm even scared of it
Lucky you they told me that I will go to toilet 🚻 after 2 days
Bro ur situation is worse again
Do u know my escort has told me to clap for two hours
Only they told me to remove civilians spirit from my head I will do it upto tomorrow
Bro as if our rooms are near. I've heard someone being slapped, was that you
Maybe you are saying the truth
I'm clapping. Can u hear anyone clap ,
Yes
Now they are grabbing my phone 📱 we meet after the court
Ok bro.
Even this guy has brought a hammer. After court I will be offline, u will get me on SMS , with my button phone

I would encourage all of you to attempt this cw.
I have also granted amnesty to all those who submitted cw late and i did reject it. I have now considered it as duly submitted within time. Next time you are advised to honour the timelines for submission of cw.
📢💨📢
Good morning fellas,
This serves to inform you that we shall have communication skills lectures today from 9am to 1pm. _Its intention is to make sure we push forward our coverage as we all know we have not been frequently having Communication skills lectures in the past weeks._
See you all in 2.5 for the  lectures
Thanks

@13135550002 say something
Hello!
@13135550002 hi
Hi!
Stop that <This message was edited>
Yoo mng fellow devs
Om Monday plan ki
You people are silent, so let AI take over
*THIS IS TO KINDLY CAUTION*
*MOBILE MONEY USERS.*
There is a new technique scammers have come up with to con people called
*'JUMPED'.*
The scammer sends you a real deposit of money into your phone using his number.
This is not a fake deposit he really sends you money a small amount  like 20,000/= or 30,000/= and you don't even doubt it.
After sending this money he then launches a withdrawal of a some huge amount on your number.
When you receive the message on your phone that you have received some money the natural thing is to be excited and then want to check your balance.
To check the balance you'll need to enter your MM pin.
The moment you do this you will have validated his withdrawal request on your account.
Your account will automatically allow his withdrawal request and take out the money.
The trick is to just lure you with a small amount initially to steal from you.
To protect yourself from this scam whenever you received such an unexpected deposit to check your balance first enter in deliberately a wrong MM pin.
This will cancel any withdrawal requests then thereafter check your balance with your real MM pin.
With this new electronic money transfers and Artificial Intelligence coming in let's do this all the time to avoid being fooled by these scammers who are always coming up with new methods to try and steal from us.
Always share such information with family and colleagues to also make them aware and be alert.
*COPIED!*
*STAY VIGILANT* ‼️‼️

@256762364149 the man is back with his links but am trying to call him but not going through 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nothing
The man should leave us . Let him take his scams to other groups
I think the account is not being used by him no @256782470261 must first remove it from the group
First of all WhatsApp has its way of communicating it's stuff . He thinks we're green about cyber security
That is it but I have seen many in different groups are victims
Maybe he opened the link and was hacked into his account
Yeah. As long as one opens that link, it's the beginning of trouble.
One of my friends is a victim
When you look at the URL, it clearly shows it's a scam . It's domain shows it all
That link automatically hack your account and transfer to another phone
Yes
The guy should first sign out of WhatsApp
Let him quickly backup information and first get wats of overcoming that malware
Admin must first remove the number from the group
Yeah. Before others fall victims
The problem is that the admins leave only us whom people consider underdogs online 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😷😷😷
But let everyone learn this today, never to open such links. Because they're malicious and dangerous
I must be mad admin there 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 because am the most active person in the group
😂😂😂😂😂😷
We're the technicians of the group, always around to oversee activities😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😹 <This message was edited>
Yes but they don't care about us 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
I saw @256786777193 typing but just disappeared what's wrong bro😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😹😷
@256782470261 will get this sorted
And you will see me admin tomorrow 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
Ok bro.
U will be made one
I trust @256782470261
For two times now
I think we should conduct a training about cyber security especially about our online behavior and safety
Such that people get to know what's bad and good
I wish they give me one day just to teach them
We should help others bro. Because some people might be victims
And many are victims by now
Yes
Including me 😂😹🤣😂😷😹
Me too 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😹😹😹
Bro let's fight hard to overcome that malware
Just make a party we dance and cuddle kigwe🥲
I must be made admin tomorrow to erase that malware from the group
We're talking about getting closer to God and ur bringing such, I think ur lost mn.
Never compare God to your parties😬😬
Ok bro
That's why I said his stupid is upgrading 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To infinity.............
If he persist he may book is place in HELL very early
Yeah. Let him even repent to God now
@256750529280 come here and repent to God very fast or else......
If he fails to repent, retake may knock his door..........
Let him act accordingly
That's it  because God has seen him
@256750529280 God has seen you now
Yes.
Let him ask what happened to Goliath
@256750529280 am calling you here as a God servant
@256750529280 the man of God is calling you out
Am give him only upto 6pm orelse he will handle the case with God Amen
Amen 🙏🙌
@256750529280 your time is almost relapsing come up
Now he's gonna face God
@256750529280 now your time has elapsed and you now have to pray hard so that God forgive you because sometimes you see what is being posted here as nonsense but God knows why everyone is typing and thinks everyone will reply to it in the right way not as you think anyway I pray that God should forgive you for what you have typed there maybe Satan was the one sending you fingers on every key you typed there
May GOD forgive you for all what you have typed there
AMEN 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
What do you want me to type
Man you were typing something don't think our eyes don't see the screen
Indeed God should forgive him.
Because he doesn't know what he did
U typed and then deleted what u intended to share in the group 😂🤣😂🤣😷😷
That thing was being sent to a different group
Oh that's why
null
May God have mercy upon him.
But he should learn to respect Godly things.
Jokes should have boundaries
Thanks bro
Eeeee....but why all that ending date 🤔🤔🤔🤔
@256762364149 if your lecturer is a football fan wait and see what will come in the paper if his team loses 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He will favor because we share the team
But we should pray hard so that this weekend teams win. Such that they can be happy and change what they had set
I don't think so
But others will not change

Absolutely. After a year, one can get money to purchase a domain name

Thanks and may God bless u as u consider it🤝🤝

we are waiting for Amorim tomorrow
to take us to the top
waaaaaaa,the higher u go the cooler it becomes,then the hell would hv been down in the mantle and hot magma
United don't get proud
just sleep you got no point
Things are aren't the way u see them
we are not proud at all
Though u got a good head, it might be difficult for him coz the players have not changed
thats why i have been saying here that another suffering is loading since he was appointed
If u don't borrow patience from the Chelsea fans, then Amorim won't make 2seasons at old Trafford
But u need to give him time as he figures out things
not even 1 bro i know man utd fans better
the way arteta was given time
Then let them forget everything
Yaaaa
They need to trust the process 🤔🤔
by the end of the season they may again be looking for a manager
Now arsenal we are atleast like omubi omwelu
thats the only option
🤣🤣🤣🤣
yeah
wait and see if they don't qualify for a European competition
I advise Amorimz to carry all players of spotting Lisbon,so that the following should leave,wama the task is to mention people who should leave manu ,eriksen,rashford ....
Let them trust one manager but they won't do anything and they'll keep on making for us noise about the past mbu champions league and so forth
they should just exchange all the squad
Onana must be the first one to mention
Naye mwe
thats our nature
they should just transfer full squad to Portugal then bring all those from Portugal to england
We are tired of such nosense, we are focussing on the present y to take us back to the past
Leave that one to stay if not him singa ten hag who left a t alevel of two hag,yandibade nga yagobebwaada
that applies when arguing with arsenal
If they do it, that sporting can't compete in premier ask Gardiola
U hate our advice look at it
Haha
But now arsenal is atleast
Wapi
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't hate but it doesn't work
not atleast but is among the best clubs in europe
If today spur has done the same thing now u will see Amorimz performance reducing
leave us bro
Ask Arne slot he can now tell wats English premier league
Thanks bro
Arsenal now is among the best
wait after the first leg is over we will see him gradually falling down
How many trophies wama
Amorim will face it
Palace will come and challenge him
This is premier where we don't entertain dictatorship
ask aston villa today
Let him be patient
His time is coming wait in the corner we are loading for him sweet games
thats our statement as man utd fans
Hahaha
Anti they don't understand this
It's premier where wolves comes and wags fulham 4
they will understand later
Yaaaa
bro have a good nyt

If you wish
ur inclusive just know
I also didn't hear that it was an assignment..I remember him saying that we learn from them
Exactly
I remember he also said that for the video, he will consider only one and double it
What do you mean
And another issue is about notes for combinations and permutation if u have handouts please lets share
Just watch and write the report the deadline it tomorrow
that applies to group B
He said not compulsory if u did the two no more doing
He said that he is going to consider the best bantu mwe
Yeah that's what i also know
Better have ur report already written
Hmm okay
Waa nooo
Exactly he said if u are not contented with the previous marks in the report u can write again if I remember very well
On the recent one or previous one
Previous ones
I am talking to group A i dont know for b

Yes yesterday for group B it was there by Madam Rose then what of group A by Madam Lydia today
It was a joint lecture for crying out loud.
It was for both Groups A and B.
Ryt
Both Madam Lydia and Madam Rose were lecture or teaching. They were both around yesterday.
God have mercy on me
It was there eh eh
Check the main group..the link is there
Seriously 😒 but it was not communicated
Exactly
Are you serious right now?!
It was crystal clear sebo.
It's okay
You missed and that's bad but you can ask your friends to tell you what happened or what they discussed about.
Berita wabadewo
Yes
Ohh
Eeeeeh but i missed alot how was  that meeting
It was okay
I just hope they send the notes
Or they were sent
Yes I even tapped the link by reaching to where I had to sign in by my name I sow madam Rose as the lecture yet madam Lydia is my leacture for communication I had to stop there and do other things
Yeah madam Rose was the lecturer on top but if you actually signed in you could see that they were co teaching
Okay but the right person to ask anyway what did they talk about
they said that if you did two last time from different topics, you don't need to do again

Good morning.
We have no class today. I will attend to students who missed the centralized test.
ohk sir🤝
We start with maximum points.  That is possible given the fluid and artistry witnessed in the last match. The fixtures are promising, not intimidating in my humble view. However, football is capable of yielding unexpected results.
We have got no lectures today
Apart from handing in the math cw
@256762364149 how is it there my brother

But I hope they are going to give it out let's wait for 11 just 4mins to go
Hmm... If person(P) and country (C) not visited(P,C)
If person (p)==True && country (c)==True && visited(p,c)==false <This message was edited>
Wrong

Yap,she is missing a NOT
If person(p)==true && country(c)==true&& visited(p,c)==false
That is Java script

Actually this is the most correct Java script
Mubijawa
Olimba

Welcome
i was wondering
why should exams begin on wednesday and eat up the weekend
i therefore want  to move a motion that our class reps may look into the matter and present this before the AR's office
SUNDAY AND SATURDAY are days for rest, monday and tuesday are for work.
i wont tag, i pray you guys look into this and humbly table it before the AR
Its alleged that either one of the days belongs to God🥲, but Ceaser wants to swallow them up. yet he has five already
BAMBI😭😭

Just like the way you move out on weekends in shopping malls..shopping nothing. Let them be there you have nothing to do on weekends. <This message was edited>
no bro, the weekend is special. mostly the saturday because it is a day of rest with God. it is the sabbath day. so its a day out with God. others chose to do it on place it on sunday.
so generally the weekend is for God.
Can u please send me the draft timetable
Thank u!
Just know your request will never be granted, you will either accept to do the papers over the weekends or do it over the weekends.
UICT have their own settings that they always abide by.
I submit 🤝

Python going viral 🤣 😂 💀 😆
It's my best language bro
It's ma best too
Great .
And I can say that it's the best
In Uganda, it's Python and Javascript that can atleast pay in the Tech industry, the rest needs one to be in the most developed countries like 🇻🇳 Vietnam

Be the student that you are and let Mr Lubanga be the lecturer he is. I see little benefit in pushing him the way you seem.to suggest. Remember he set the test and may be you are not his supervisor!

I will watch the match with you
No problem if you can come upto my residence
The problem I'm now in Kenya
Even me am going to Rwanda after 2 hrs
Ok.
Safe travels bro
Thanks bro
Man U is finished
Tomorrow some fans are going to be silent
Others may miss presentations for fear 😂😂😂😂
Yes.
And others may go to the hospital after fainting 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Yeah
But in any way it must end in tears for one side , I believe no draw may come out
I wished we have a lecture for Mr @256702431529 after the game for more analysis after being beaten 🤣
Even me I don't want any draw there at all 😂😂😂😂
We will tag him here but just know when they lose his option for the man of the match will be the referee as it was against Man City 😂😂😂😂😂
After man u being beaten
Then he will be very happ6
Man U is losing
Tell them
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣he will start blaming VAR and Michael Oliver 🤣🤣
Waaaaaaaaaa, arsenal we don't complain
United is either winning or making a draw🤸
Exactly
😂😂😂 that's all he always have after losing
Make sure you don't regret what you're saying, because Emirates is gonna erupt today
Bournemouth did something
No draw, no Man U win.
It's either Arsenal win or Man U loss
My friend, arsenal is the only team now with support star magicians. Don't even waste your time waiting for arsenal's loss
The fact that we are at Emirates...u guys deserve to win but big remains big... united is winning today
If and only if Saka scores and gives an assist
When did Man U last beat Arsenal 🤣😂😂
Wc year was it
2022
Another return there on 11th January next year
Another loss for man U
But it's a bit far
But we don't want to beat them twice FA must use the result coming today
No matter the words from my arsenal fans I still believe AMORIM will humble them down 👎
Let's wait.
He will regret having visited Emirates
🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸
Not only visiting Emirates Stadium but even leaving Sporting
🤣🤣🤣🤣but u pipo have more words
Not more but less
U pipo have forgotten arsenal just suffered losses recently
What of utd?
Anti we going to watch a replay. Automatic arsenal win💪💪💪
Ok bro
null
If these probability wins were true then mancity would be taking it personal
Yeah. He's gonna regret the decision in his  entire career
We have facts only
U mean utd is unbeaten 😂🤣🤣🤣
Like Bayern I the league 😂😂😂😂
67 and 14😂🤣😂😂
Beating it is something easy
Unbeaten in December
Ok
We waiting in peace
Very easy like drinking water
For sure you're the best
No one can ever trust man U
Assured ,
Arsenal
Even Amorin himself 😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Show them
Sealed one
🤣🤣😂😂😂
Darlot bowed down that day
Exactly. Just waiting to pick our points
Do they still need other evidence for assured Arsenal's win?
Yes, show them
💪
Just continue showing them
Ohhhh, the man is a serious magician
I see man U losing
Guns bro 😂😂
That's it
Wise boy
🤣
Celebrating after the 4th goal
In First half 😂😂😂
Yes, in 20th minute
You know the truth
Yeah
Man U is gonna ask for water
Who told you that Amorin is not knowing?
After 10 minutes
Yes.
And Amorim is gonna learn new game tactics today
Let him come with his 343 formation 😄😂😂😂
To concede 5 goals 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
In halftime only 😂😂😂
Yes 😂😂😂
But he will get a consolation goal
That's sure to make him also feel abit proud
Yeah
Man I miss Maguire
But he is my favourite player in Manchester United there
Me too
I started liking him from Leicester city
He's cool and experienced
But Man U spoiled him 😔
That's why Southgate used to like him among the defenders in the England squad
Too much
Yeah
And even the media
But his form will be back with time to come
Yes
Incase u missed out on Saturday

"Hey Gunners, it's matchday at the Emirates! ⚽ But don’t get too comfortable at home—Rashford, Bruno, and the boys are bringing the heat. 🔥 Don’t be surprised if the Red Devils turn your fortress into a playground. 😉 Let’s see if you can hold up! #GGMU 🔴🔱"

Good morning here
What's up with the online meetings of communications skills? @256782470261 @256777962860
Ready groups should contact madam on whether she is free or fixed
u need Jesus bro
4 sure, I thought even some serious breaking news, all to hear Iz this trash
arsenal fans are running mad this
U need a mentor
Hahaha, but PL isn't theirs, let them 4get it
Ur right it is for manU,Any complain ask Ten hag
😂😂😂😂😂😂 violence
We wacha wewe, fast look at yo position then talk
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ask him well , leave no stone unturned
U can tok ov Chelsea, at least for it its behind the table leader
What of man U
what of City
the losing team
they are going to fight for relegation escape 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hmmmm, manu should just give up on football
Daz it
Ahhhh, gwe city surprises pipol
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣
we are fighting for survival only 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
it indeed surprised people with a winless run
5 for 5 😂😂😂😂😂
Amorim has started the usual business that Ten Hag left uncomplished😆😆
Be patient, u will see pep carrying the trophy and u will be crucified for being jesus of arsenal
Absolutely
No worries, 4 that
yeah
He is not Amorin but AMURIAT 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Impossible without Rodri
indeed he's Amuriat
Hahaha, just know arsenal will never take the throne, as they say now days. FIFA( Football Isn't For Arsenal)
yeah
from the East 😂😂😂😂😂
and Halaand has to apologise to Arteta
But unfortunately he gonna come back towards the end ov the season
yeah,
Mmmm, that arteta boy needs no apologies
by then they will be only 20points from the top 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahaha
Naye tulinde, pep is a magician
thats it then they may fail to play UCL
Arne slot is a mentor of Amorim, Pep is a mentor to mikel,then mikel is a mentor to Arne slot,4rm trusted source
Let them go for Europa and be the pros
Arteta can never qualify to be a mentor nawe
Thats why it will be for Arsenal
Nae
or even conference
nedda bro
And finally they find themselves in the FUFA drum hahaha
Pep is going to mislead mikel at the end
Kiki ate, wen did arsenal last win a trophy
2023
He cant tell zat is the toughest question to all arsenal fans
Hahaha
Kati labono, which trophy ate
And yet pep have already written the addresses of his resignation later and almost going to the salutation 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Era ur on mole
or fifth devision
Naye pep is already a legend, treble holder, plus 6 PL titles in a row
or regionals
correct your statement not in a row at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kyekyo, masaza cup should sign them, am gonna call the katikiro to add them
they will play as a new comers
Kale, naye he grabbed 6 ov them, which arteta will never and never achieve
Anha
How old are they?
make sure you don't regret this statement after 7 years
Lets wait by the end of the season
Am telling u, u can bet arteta can never achieve a trebble
As long as they are 6, any problem with that
ok bros
This year Arteta will win only 2 trophies
Which ones
Epl and UCL but those smaller feeding cups will also be won but he will not call them trophies
Exactly
Waaaaa, he can't take them pliz
Not even the golden golve
who took it last season
🫠
one match to be on top again for that golsen glove
Arteta is just there to provide and feed Arsenal fans with joy,but at the end he presents nothing ,if i doesnt make sense how many premier league  trophies
many hopes
That small boy can't shake EPL at all, even though he applies juju
😀😀😀it's for onana
i will remind you this statement next year in may
Jesu, y iz that name even being mentioned
if my favourite player Maguire regains his usual form he can
I will not need it pliz
and that's how you were tipping Man U to win on Wednesday, what happened
no in april
Hahaha
but i like the way he plays when with the national team and thats why he is my favourite in utd
my favorite player in utd was Fred
The best keeper in the league
Yoro
his style of play can fit best in Spain and with Barcelona only
Waaa, at least say Raya, not our fellow African, that one even degea waz good
now you are hating utd
With time he will be better than Saliba
Who told u I loved it at fast
Ehhhhh
Wat about yo broda, Jizos
ok bro
Good boy
You will see when he takes the golve
If he had gone to barca
Ok
am ever a good boy
news from Mr Musingo
Ok
😀😀time will tell

Hello guys anyone to help with Computational mathematics past papers
*THE* *TRUE* *NATURE* *OF* *HUMAN* *BEINGS*
One day, a pregnant woman was referred to a big hospital to have a caesarean session done. After the surgery, there was a bill of about 1 million to be paid. The hospital attendant started calling her relatives including her husband, and the only thing they said was, they don't have money, so she remained in the hospital for about five days without anyone coming or paying, neither calling back to know what was going on.
On the fifth day, the doctor decided to trick them. He got a phone, and started calling all the relatives, telling them that he was sorry the woman died in the course of the week together with the baby due to lack of care. He requested them to come and collect the bodies with 4 millions as the hospital bills.
To their surprise, in about 3 hours, about 10 relatives had arrived at the hospital putting on black with sad faces of losing their relatives, and they had come with all the 4 millions together with coffins and the Ambulance to take the bodies.
After seeing them, the hospital attendants together with the doctor, were surprised at them, and asked them to pay the bill before they took what they had come for. After they had done so, the doctor went inside and brought the lady together with her healthy daughter and handed her over to them.
They were shocked to see her walking, and she was shocked to see them carrying a coffin and ambulance with them. They all knelt down to ask for forgiveness but at that time it had no meaning in the life of the woman.
QUESTIONS
1. If you are among the relatives, what do you say?
2. If you are the husband, what do you say?
3. If you are the patient, what do you do next?
4. If you are called to reconcile the family, what do you say?
Your answer must be helping you and me to learn from this experience.
Eh
Bambi
That's real life situation

We need to atleast get some pipo out there to hold de DCS flag
@256782470261 who would you recommend as a suitable guild candidate ?
I for one would recommend you because I’ve seen your commendable leadership abilities !

Anyone with the notes about public speaking please help and share the paper is 2mro
And that is ?
Check your inbox
What of effective communication

@256782470261 is going to be the GRC of DCS!
I truly appreciate your help
@256782470261 say your words her
Ooh no maybe some one else has them in soft copy
Nae gwe notes ngannyinji

Even we the LMRA we need those notes
I am also getting to know that I am missing much notes oloowoza birungi
I am lykly to fast this remaining tym for God to just render a helping hand
We don't fast at night
People are loosing b4ns ur telling me to give u mine tym for offertory not yet anko
For me I do from 00
Hmm
Here is the man
Yuh can make your point without putting anyone down📌
If yuh don’t see a leader in Tendo,, then come out on behalf of your clan and become the first person to be a leader at school.
Stop having lazy brains of down minding people because of your immature opinions
Noisemaker is coming
I will come in direct to yuh @256761860938
Buh yuh started it as war
them talk I will be there
With evidence,,,, when did Tendo ever pay yuh ..??
Guys let be mature in handling matters of importance
Can yuh read the message yuh sent again….??
Or yuh study basic communication skills jhus to have poor communication skills 🤌
This is politics en it's a dirty game if u never know
Then don’t make your mind dirty before the game itself
Why delete the message then.
Bro,,, yuh can come up en we shall still support yuh if your manifesto is due buh not saying that “those TENDO of your who pay people”
Like has bro ever paid yuh any penny to vote for
Stop spreading negativity Emmanuel 📌✌️ <This message was edited>
you people @256703094704 will lock the group if you annoy him
I can’t bro
We need to be transparent in some matters that are crucial
ok then its good bro let them also have their views me am still out
but he said he will not do so which is good
Seems this will not end the only option is to disorganise the net work
We DCS are the vision of uict leadership buh still our insights matter a lot to weigh our thinking.
“WE CAN HOLD A GOOD ELECTION WITHOUT CAUSING HAVOC”
let me only go in peace
As the tym reduces the number of pdfs 4 communication skills increase, who can Guess the variation
The way I fear that , I respect
No one is refusing anyone's view,
Coz we all av a ryt to speech but the thing is, u shud raise ur points by nt trying to mek others look so bad, yet the issue you are giving as an excuse is not true even, Have ur own leader, everyone has a right to democracy buh dont make other look so bad
back in high school 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for letting him know….📌✌️❤️
Eeeeeeeh
I now end this,,, unless otherwise
Nuts to y’all
Nice one 😂
Coz i saw wat u deleted, @256761860938 Act ur age,
N learn to accept ur mistake wen corrected, coz u will lose opportunities due to poor communication skills, i sign out
So, if yuh act we DIE…???
Come on young man

Happiest birthday dear
Mr Akena Andrew Happy Birthday 🎈
Happy birthday my opponent we meet again next year in hackerthon 👊
"Thanks soo much to my fellow programmers, for your kind and thoughtful wishes n making it extra special. I feel so lucky to have amazing people like you in my life. Sending love and gratitude to you all!🤝
Happy birthday Akena
Happy programmer 😅
There’s this guy I know ! he’s like a walking piece of code: simple, precise, and always on point, just like a perfectly executed function. If he had a MOTTO , it’d be something like
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
printf("CODING");
return 0;
}
Straightforward, no extra fluff, just like his moves and mindset. It’s as if life handed him a #define BIG_AHEAD directive, and he’s been running that macro ever since. MORE B.D WISHES SIR!🎂
Happy birthday @256788667098
More years of good health and wealth. Keep being the good man you’ve always been 🎉🎊🎂
More years ✨of coding
Happy birthday 🎉🎂....
Tnx sir

Thank you so much for the heartfelt condolences my DCS family have been sharing with me since yesterday 7pm when I lost my mum.
It is infact not a simple situation but as a believer, i know all were God's plans though to some extent it's said that God gives but the devil takes
To allow me continue well with my papers, I managed to secure her body for one week in the mortuary as I and my siblings make necessary preparations. As a family, information about her send off will be communicated here the moment the storms calm
Success to us in the remaining papers family 👪 🙏 <This message was edited>

Question ❓
I have come across a question asking four types of programming languages;; are we supposed to give paradigms because for them they are four but they usual ones we know the HL, LL and scripting are only three. Who could be having an idea.
Labisaa
🏃😳🏃
@256777779815 the unbeaten run will be broken today I surrender now 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️

I'll provide detailed answers to each question.
*Section A*
1. *Principles of Programming Languages*
The principles of programming languages refer to the fundamental concepts, rules, and guidelines that govern the design, development, and use of programming languages.
*Objectives of Principles of Programming Languages*
1. To provide a framework for designing and evaluating programming languages.
2. To enable effective communication among programmers, developers, and users.
*Programming Paradigms*
1. *Imperative Programming*: Focuses on describing how to perform a task. Example: C, Java.
2. *Object-Oriented Programming*: Organizes software design around objects and their interactions. Example: Java, C++.
3. *Functional Programming*: Emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data structures. Example: Haskell, Lisp.
*Need for Multiple Programming Paradigms*
Multiple programming paradigms are necessary because different paradigms are better suited for different problem domains, programming tasks, and developer preferences.
*Skills Required to Become a Computer Programmer*
1. *Problem-Solving Skills*: Ability to analyze problems, identify solutions, and implement them.
2. *Programming Language Skills*: Proficiency in one or more programming languages.
3. *Debugging Skills*: Ability to identify and fix errors in code.
*Types of Computer Programming Languages*
1. *High-Level Languages*: Abstract, easy to learn, and portable. Example: Java, Python.
2. *Low-Level Languages*: Close to machine language, efficient, and platform-dependent. Example: Assembly, C.
3. *Scripting Languages*: Designed for rapid development, flexible, and often used for web development. Example: JavaScript, PHP.
*Advantages of Learning Computer Programming*
1. *Improved Problem-Solving Skills*: Programming helps develop analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
2. *Enhanced Career Opportunities*: Knowledge of programming languages is a highly valued skill in the job market.
3. *Increased Creativity*: Programming allows individuals to express their creativity and bring ideas to life.
*Characteristics of a Successful Computer Programming Language*
1. *Support*: Availability of documentation, community support, and development tools.
2. *Simplicity and Readability*: Easy to learn, understand, and maintain.
3. *Reliability*: Consistent behavior, minimal errors, and robust security features.

*Section B*
*Question 2*
*Algorithm*
A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific goal.
*Types of Algorithms*
1. *Recursive Algorithms*: Solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.
2. *Iterative Algorithms*: Solve problems using loops and conditional statements.
*Pseudo-Code Key Words*
1. *INPUT*: Read data from the user or a file.
2. *OUTPUT*: Display data to the user or write to a file.
3. *LOOP*: Repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met.
*Flow-Chart Symbols*
1. *Input/Output*: Represented by a parallelogram.
2. *Process*: Represented by a rectangle.
3. *Decision*: Represented by a diamond.
*Question 3*

2. *Interpretation*: The program is translated into machine code line-by-line during execution.
*Stages of Compiling a Program*
1. *Lexical Analysis*: Breaking the source code into individual tokens.
2. *Symbol Table Construction*: Creating a table to store information about variables and symbols.
3. *Syntax Analysis*: Parsing the tokens to ensure the program follows the language's syntax rules.

A Voice for Digital Excellence: Your Next DCS Representative
Dear fellow DCS students,
As we wrap up our remarkable first semester at UICT, I, Yonah Odongkara, wish to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible journey we've shared. Our cohort has demonstrated exceptional unity and dedication, setting a strong foundation for our two-year journey in this globally recognized institution.
Looking ahead to the upcoming semester starting March 3rd, 2024, I am excited to announce my candidacy for the Guild Representative Council position. My vision extends beyond mere representation – I aim to be a catalyst for transformative change in student governance at UICT, particularly for our DCS community.
My leadership experience and passionate commitment to student welfare position me uniquely to advocate for our interests. I envision a GRC that prioritizes academic excellence while fostering an environment where every DCS student's voice matters. As your representative, I pledge to champion initiatives that align with Uganda's Vision 2040 for digital transformation, ensuring our department remains at the forefront of ICT education.
I believe in fair, responsive, and professional leadership that serves the collective interest rather than individual agendas. My approach will focus on quality legislation and meaningful representation, creating a bridge between student needs and institutional governance.
As we enter 2025, let's embrace a year of professional growth and positive change. Together, we can establish DCS as a beacon of excellence in UICT's student governance. Your support will enable me to transform these aspirations into reality, creating a more dynamic and inclusive student experience for all.
Let's make our time at UICT truly memorable and impactful. <This message was edited>

@256705439947 is a man U fan who denied it during the downfall of Han Ten.
It is believed that the numerous losses under Hag prompted him to disguise himself as a Man city fan, leaving Mayuni FC with its trouble
The first to score
@ Mr noise maker,wait till the end mancity will win the premier league
Furthermore, he wanted to follow the footsteps of his descendants such as De Gea
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 me laughing in paragraph
I want to make it clear am a utd fan but at the same time,I like pep for his modern style of play
Am a footballer not over till it's over
@256767475239 the loses from Manchester United have followed him ( @256705439947 ) to the new destination 😂😂😂😂😂
Exactly
And it's funny, when Man U was playing with city, he supported city and it lost
🤜🤜🤜
I just like the modern football of pep not supporting man city
Why are you trying to prove yourself 😹😹😹
We know ur Amuriat' grandson <This message was edited>

Am doing good and you?
And must be very soon
I entered to the doctors room speaking English and he told me to go to the Phlebotomy...…… Then thats where I remembered my mother tongue and asked him "Dakatal itye ikobo ni ngo?" 😂😂😂😂🙌🙌
Doing well

I have a big deal for those interested in learning Python
Tell me I am also interested

Ok bro
As we advance in Python knowledge, such that by the time we start Sem2, people have attained  knowledge about the language
not bad
U have always been the best, Merry Christmas n a happy New Year
Python is an English language...
Keep watching. Do you notice that the difference between the team.on top of the pile and the Citizens is less than 15 points and we are yet to run fixtures into the 2nd Round? Never laugh at a giant on the ground. <This message was edited>
Let's watch but this time round, I doubt the Citizens winning the title
They still have a realistic chance. Its not over until its over. <This message was edited>
True
Let's wait for the Elephant
Teams do recover from setbacks during the campaign but I think no team has ever won the premier league after losing 5 matches
justify ur submission
U av all the resources to do that urself
seriously

Avoid pretending that you are still young.   Always remember that time does not wait for anybody. Think twice about your age. As the days go by, we approach our resting place.  Ask yourself these questions:
What have I really done for my family, relatives, friends, and God since I came to this earth?
Is there anything I can still do?
So do something now because time is passing swiftly, and it may be too late. Every day you get older, make yourself a treasure because this world is temporary.
Be grateful to God and start to push forward with determination and hard work with prayer and diligence, and you will gain eternal life, which is HEAVEN.
*BEWARE OF "ONE DAY"*
ONE DAY, you will retire from active civil service and start leaving a private life.
ONE DAY another person will be sitting on your seat and be in your position.
ONE DAY, you will lock your door, but you will not be the one to open it.
ONE DAY, you will wash those best clothes of yours and you will not be able to wear it.
ONE DAY, your favorite food will be prepared, and you will not be there to eat it anymore.
ONE DAY, you will eat and drink what you will never excrete.
ONE DAY, your curriculum vitae and all your years of experience will not matter to anyone anymore.
ONE DAY, the person who seems to love you most will never dare to move closer to you.
ONE DAY, you will think of what you can never accomplish.
ONE DAY, you will be regarded as "a corpse"
ONE DAY, you will be isolated in a place called "grave"
ONE DAY, those things and people you love most will come your way, but you will not be able to give any attention to it/them.
ONE DAY, you will hold your breath and never be able to release it.
ONE DAY, you will become a defendant before The Chief Judge (GOD).
ONE DAY, housefly/ termites will come your way, and you will be unable to chase them.
ONE DAY, you will receive a call that you can never decline.
ONE DAY, your name will be called, but no one will answer.
ONE DAY, the assets you cherished most will be taken by another person.
ONE DAY, your deed on Earth will be presented to you like a CD.
ONE DAY a title will be added to your name "Late"
ONE DAY, The Great Allocator will allocate you to an appropriate place.
ONE DAY, that your beautiful skin will turn to its original nature-sand/dust.
ONE DAY, your entire body will cease operation. The verb will change from he is a good man to he was a good man.
ONE DAY, you will be given an eternal apartment, either Paradise or hell.
ONE DAY, you will not be able to hold nor type anything on this phone anymore.
In summary, take LIFE easy, DO GOOD, and run from EVIL. Be at peace with everyone, love your neighbor as yourself, and remember that "that ONE DAY will surely come when this write-up shall be fulfilled in your life."
Please inform  your loved ones and people you wish to save from hell to remind THEM about that ONE DAY'
May God continue to bless and guide us so as to be conscious of tomorrow..
Be careful how you live today
Don't cherish worldly things more than the creator of the world
Remember, someone owns your life
Don't cause people to  cry because of your maltreatment to them
Only one thing will not perish after you have gone , that's your good work,
Thanks so much.
🙏.
U deserve a gift <This message was edited>

Good morning to you
Good morning 2 sir
I'm good 👍
Great
I rather take Torrero instead of supporting that team 😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amuriat is frustrated.
Maybe Mayuni FC is just cursed
It's boxing day, meaning gifts are put into boxes and presented to friends.
Not 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Tell those who think about boxing only
Mn that day is mistaken for 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
It's for this boxing 🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁
yeah
null
Wacha wewe
Thats the truth
you'll die at a young age😅
this arteta of  a guy also, y always keeping partey out🤒
He needs to rest
nara just minimising Ipswich
Trust the process
Partey is aged and he needs to be used sparingly
kale, we wait
Alright
I better include Van Basten than Ronaldo and Ronaldinho
ooooh
I have not watched videos of most them save Messi, Cafu, Zidane and Maldini. I have heard lots of kind and nice things said about Pele, Cruyff and Maradona. The rest I have no clue.  I am.therefore unable to say whether they deserve or not. As for Messi he has to be there. <This message was edited>
then C. Ronaldo
May be the Magazine needed 2 best 11s. One for 1900s and the other for 2000s. What defined the best then in.the 19s might be different from what we value now in the 2000s. They may need to save us the bother of comparing unlike set of players.
Messi is GOAT
Thank you @256751706107
Thanks princess🥰
Without Ronaldo

Happy sunday family
Cristiano Ronaldo has compared Manchester United to an aquarium.
"The Premier League is the toughest league in the world, all teams are good, everyone competes, all players are strong. Football has changed, there are no easy matches anymore.
"I said this a year and a half ago, and I will keep saying it: the problem is not the coaches.
"I always give this example: it's like an aquarium. If there's a sick fish in it, you take it out, solve the problem, and put it back, it will get sick again. And Manchester United have the same problem. The problem is not just the coach, it’s much bigger.
"I'm 100% sure [the problem is not solved]. If I become the owner, I will fix everything and change what's bad right now," said the forward of Al-Nassr and the Portugal national team .
Cristiano Ronaldo: 'I will definitely be the owner of a big club'
Next semester guys have lunch .... Oba I mention them 😂😂

1. Are they twins?
Yes, they are twins because they were born from the same pregnancy.
2. Are they age mates?
Technically, they are not exact age mates since they were born in different years, but practically, they are considered age mates because their birthdays are only a few minutes apart.
3. Which year will they claim?
The first baby will claim 2024, and the second will claim 2025 as their birth years.
4. In which month will they celebrate their birthday?
The first baby will celebrate in December, while the second will celebrate in January.
As the final moments of 2024 gracefully fade into history, we stand at the threshold of a promising new chapter. Through the tapestry of triumphs and trials that defined the past year, humanity's resilience has shone brilliantly. Each challenge we faced has only strengthened our collective spirit, forging bonds that transcend borders and differences.
As we embrace 2025, let us carry forward not just our hopes and dreams, but also the wisdom gained from our shared experiences. May this year herald an era of unprecedented compassion, innovation, and unity. Together, let's craft a future where kindness prevails and human potential knows no bounds.
Welcome, 2025. Let's make it extraordinary.
Yonah
Happy new year 🎉 ✨

@256750468163
Waiting for your predictions
Prepared to concede
@256767475239 Man Utd can win if they used the trick for that Fa cup which they won where Maguire was STRIKING while Bruno Fernandes DEFENDING 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Maguire is in
They will switch positions
Then they will win
Yeah 😂
@256750468163 what do you have to say
@256767475239  to be sincere I didn't want to watch that match but since my favourite player Maguire is starting I will go there
Me too.
I've finished setting up Cartoon Network
ok but we have only 1hr 02mins to go
Yeah
The game of Ipswich is interesting
And they should win
Yep
But even my unbeaten team in Europe is playing Super cup at the same time when UTD will be playing I may divide the time equally
Ok
But that's a sure win.
# You will never walk alone
# The theatre of dreams
yeah
And they will lift the trophy today!
Yep
I have my friend of Man U and I'm going to buy him  ice cold Rwenzori water to cool the body after Salah' hat trick <This message was edited>

Ok but I have an information for Manchester united fans 😂😂😂😂😂

Yes
Very very well
Bro whenever you reads my messages in the group I usually see you 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This did not account for Maguires value on the pitch.
Zirkzee should have atleast tried to hit🥅

That was the best. Any other different thing would have been display of immaturity.

All these words for a draw 🤣🤣👍

As long as i av seen happy new yr, the other words make no sense😂😂😂

Good night/ good morning

Arsenal for life
Shut up

Greetings guys, i thank God for taking us all through the previous year. it is not becoz He loves us more but becoz He has somethings He wnts us to do, to know and to appreciate in life
for me one of those things, wic is of top priority is to come to the understanding and appreciation of wat He did for us at the Calvary tree. the investment made at the rugged cross is a cause of joy and excitement. it is an investment i would like us to invest in ourselves
I just finished reading "The High Cost of the Cross," and I feel compelled to share some key insights with you all. Here are three main points that really stood out to me:
The True Significance of Christ's Sacrifice: The cross represents the ultimate defeat of evil and the highest investment made for our salvation. It’s a powerful reminder of how much we are valued.
Understanding the Cost of Salvation: Many of us may not fully grasp the depth of Christ's suffering and the price He paid. Recognizing this can transform our perspective on faith and life.
Personal Connection: This investment was made for each one of us individually. It’s not just a historical event; it’s a personal invitation to embrace the love and grace offered to us.
I encourage you all to dive into this book and seek a deeper understanding of this incredible investment made on your behalf. Let’s reflect on what it truly means for our lives! 🙏❤️
Blessings
Assure us
I give you my word 😎
*No NYASH, no HIPS and no BREAST just a LIVING RULER while no BEARDS, no PACS and no MONEY just a NON LIVING THING 😂😂😂😂*
😂😂😂😂😁😁😁eeeeeer
😂😂😂😂
Its a draw game 1:1 😂😂😂
Seems this Arsenal fan who has put this visited butabika physcatric hospital
That's our joy, to disappoint Mayuni FC fans
Haha, mayuni fans ehhh
Don't take social media so serious we play here, even if you're ugly we say.."WOW SO CUTE 🥰" just to avoid depression 🤦🤣🤣

@256742112671 and @256760600494 do you people really sleep?

Heavenly father we give you thanks for  keeping us alive we thank you for your grace and mercies that made available in our lives we thank you for not allowing the devourers to devour us by night thank you Lord for all that you have done for us in Jesus name
O Lord we ask this morning that you guide us directly into the right parts let your will be done for us in Jesus name and let your name alone be glorified in our lives now and forever more in Jesus name amen 🙌🙏

IN 2025, WHAT IF?
1. If you don’t make that move now, you won’t know if it will be a success.
2. If you don't stop complaining, the needed change will not come.
3. If you don't take up the opportunity, someone else will take it up.
4. If you don’t take risks, you’ll never know how far you can go.
5. If you don’t act, the dream will remain just a dream.
6. If you wait for the perfect moment, it may never come.
7. If you’re afraid of failure, you’ll miss the chance to succeed.
8. If you keep doubting yourself, you’ll never reach your potential.
9. If you don’t start now, you’ll be stuck in the same place next year.
10. If you don’t learn from your mistakes, you’ll repeat them.
11. If you don’t push yourself, no one else will.
12. If you keep waiting for permission, you’ll never take control of your life.
13. If you don’t make sacrifices now, you’ll regret them later.
14. If you don’t believe in yourself, no one else will.
15. If you don’t take action, your ideas will remain just ideas.
16. If you don’t try, you’ve already failed.
17. If you don’t face your fears, you’ll never grow beyond them.
18. If you keep making excuses, you’ll never make progress.
19. If you don’t embrace challenges, you’ll never discover your true strength.
20. If you don’t act with urgency, opportunities will pass you by.
21. If you don’t commit to your goals, you won’t achieve them.
22. If you don’t stop procrastinating, you’ll never see results.
23. If you keep waiting for others to make the change, it will never happen.
24. If you don’t take the leap, you’ll never experience the rewards.
25. If you don’t invest in yourself, no one else will.
▪Your future is shaped by the decisions you make and actions you take today.
▪Don’t let fear or doubt hold you back from achieving your dreams.
▪The world is waiting for you to make your move.
▪Take that first step, and the path will unfold before you.
▪The only thing standing between you and your success is the decision to begin.

Girls don't want a "serious relationship".
Girls want:
• Status
• Financial security
• Passionate sex with dominant men
If one man can provide that, that's cool.
If not, they'll use as many men as necessary.

yeah
That's a simple issue
The guy is smart and intelligent
But we dont know the BRAIN only the pen he used will show us
We're different people, and hence we live different lives
Results don't determine our fate
you get 0 points and say so if its true
If he came with a helicopter..the just know he will pass..its so easy to pass uneb with money
@256767475239 maybe here can also work
As long as he gets at least a principal pass and subsidiaries, he's good to go. <This message was edited>
thats
He needs two principal passes to go to a university.... right?
Yeah
Even with one he can pursue a diploma
And UICT is a better option
Tell her
I mean..if he wants to go to a university straight away
Many Universities offer diploma courses as long as one has a principal pass
Maybe with bachelors
Ohhh that's the clarity I needed
Alright
*My work is always to bring arguments and rum away!*
Last year in August as we joined UICT, many students joined Universities for diploma courses, with only one principal pass and the two principal passes
But that is only valid if one has no F
Got it
It's not an argument, but rather a conversation

Ya, we're very strong
ok
We've started
Am even seeing it
That's great,
Just seeing but watching AKILI and BUSH BABY
We're the Arsenal
😎😎😎😎
And most of them were Man U fans
@256750468163
No, ur accusing her
I know @256701448552  was one of them
And @256777779815 too
Yeah
*But we were not disappointed by Yamal and Rafinha also!*
Why are you lying, u were disappointed by the Arsenal win
Knowing my team is a threat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
To you
Barcelona - Betis 5:1 @256701448552 come here Yamal scored again!
*Espaly - PSG 2:4 Desire Doue and Barcola scored again
*
That's called humiliation pro max 😂😂😂😎
I was waiting for your comment but the medics attended to him for that which Trossard did to him

Let dem bring de premier league teams to me in champions league
Let me first ask you, Will Man UTD also come? 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Isn't the game today a relegation battle? I mean mayuni united and Southampton,
I pray the weaker side wins the game 🤓
Relegation battle 🙌🙌🙌😁🤔😊😂
Let dem bring all at once ad they make one team vs Barcelona
ok but excluding Mayuuni FC coz they dont qualify to be there 😝😝😝😝
The goal was to eliminate Arsenal 😂
This ain't substantial 🤓
But that was FA and this is Premier
*Where you lose and go behind by 1 step!*
Yeah
But now am at 14th place with 6 points above relegation zone with 5 goals
*Oh sorry I meant 15th and -5 goals @256767475239 and @256782470261  🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🫣🫣🫣*
That's the relegation battle , any slight mistake gives you an upper hand to be in the red zone
yeah 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And let @256761860938 not worry because Man U will fight hard for conference league positions
That's a fake consolation 😂😂
*They are complaining that the top 8 teams in Europa should be promoted to play UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE knockouts 🤣🤣🤣🤣*
Even if they're allowed, what will Man U do in Champions League 👌👌👌👌👌
They will be demoted to come and play 5th division in Uganda 🤣🤣🤣
Maybe they can try the Uganda Cup but then they can't survive BUL FC <This message was edited>
Not only BULS but even WATERS FC 🤣🤣🤣
And then the king 👑
Thats it
Have a good morning bro .

Olemwa
Continue losing like that
U guys are greedy, why are you fighting for positions with relegation teams. Leave them in peace
Stay away from arsenal fans who think united can be relegated 🚮🚮
We're only speaking the truth .
You guys are just greedy. Top four positions are there but you chose to fight with small teams , it's a shame
In EPL we don't have a small team ...all teams are big
Ur trying to justify your current position 😂😂🙌🙌
So if united is now a small team..how come it beat u with 9boys
That's history, let's talk about Brighton
💪💪💪💪
I just want to tell you that football of now days changed...we nolonger have big teams ...we only have the tactics used that enables one win
It's also history now🤣🤣🤣
Then Southampton would be at the top
😷😷
The formation they use is the same like tht of united.....so this shows you tht it's the players tht don't adopt to tht formation
Not really , you will understand that there are big teams and small teams
Enjoy

Man he looks like someone of 31🤣🤣🤣
Thats the effect of Uganda Waragi 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Locally distilled
yeah 🤣🤣
Some people think that breaking the heart for someone from Northern is easy but my dear we went through a lot since childhood.
1. We went through Olumolum rebels.
2. Lakwena's rebel who can shoot you with a stone turn into a bomb.
3. Cattle rustlers from Karamoja called Olok.
4. Joseph Kony's rebels.
5. Too much sunshine.
Not only the above upto now the K'jongs are still disturbing our villages where we hear boom gunshots every minute and you think we are scared of heartbreaks. We just pretend to be heartbroken to make you feel happy 🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌
*#Noise Maker just passing to inform you!*
What of us from South Sudan
We are almost equal to you but they make love too important 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wat ov us from DRC
I dont know for you 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
Known for the famous Pygmy race 🤣🤣🤣🙌
yeah 😅😅😅😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
@256782345658 do you want some more facts
short but tall down
Not really
For wat
DRC people .
Wat the hell did they do, the similarity btn DRC and south Sudan iz that their citizens are war lords and others are war veterans, gunshots never cease these 2 countries, even right now as we tok, bullets are dancing in the air
But DRC guys eat dogs 🤣🤣
Not all, it's a particular group of people
Yeah. They even come to Uganda and get dogs to sell
For meat
To me it's another case, I have not seen them eating dogs, but I have seen them eating cassava and yam leaves
Bro it means you saw Ugandans.
Some Congolese guys eat dog meat
Here in Kampala,  you find them with a heap of cassava leaves they cook and eat the same way we eat Nakati and spinach
Even Ugandans eat such.
I said I have not seen Congolese eating dogs here, I didn't say they are not here or you are lying,  I said to me I haven't seen any but that doesn't take away the fact that there is a group that eats dogs
I have seen Congolese mainly
Bro here in Kampala there are many who eat dogs. They buy cheaply and sell to fellows
You ask @256782345658 🤣
Let them tell me I direct them to free dogs, these dogs that KCCA always gives poison on streets 😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those guys have suppliers from Ghetto. Each mature dog costs 20k. So 10 dogs daily, that's cool business
Cool but  don't you think they will start stealing people's dogs, and they will start giving as michomo from dogs meat.
That already started. That's why I don't eat from some places. I'd rather go to a Restaurant. Because some guys mix beef with dog meat,
Even Restaurants it's the same case
It depends on the Restaurant
null
I was in Masaka in my childhood and they used to bring dead bodies from Rakai and supply them to Restaurants in Masaka. Some Restaurants were shutdown
Not all Restaurants are authentic but some are.
Oh My God
Those guys were night dancers
Togenda mu toninyila😅
Yes😅😅
I don't.
Cheap food isn't cheap as it appears
Yes😅😅
I rather spend much money than risk😷 my life, eating dead bodies
True😅😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
But you can't even tell that it's a dead body
Bro I will never eat from Masaka restaurants 🤣
I rather eat Chapati
Nedda , otyaki. Ebyo byali byada
There are rules and regulations now that govern
I will eat from Hotels man
I will not accept to eat any meat. At least vegetables
Olina akatengo kanji😅😅
Nze tolina byogamba, I eat😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
But did they throw away those sauce pans they used to cook dead bodies
At least fish I eat
Nae gwe
You are joking
How ?
At least fish can't be replaced and duplicated <This message was edited>
Hehe, meat remains meat
The way that fish stinks, and the way it needs time
U mean Masaka fish🤔
No, any fish man
This thing of removing bones takes time to me, Don know about you
It takes time with small fish
Even big ones
Eat your meat😅😅, but maybe the big Nile pearch <This message was edited>
Yeah that one doesn't disturb
That one is Kawa
Yeah.  Though it's very expensive
But last year I enjoyed it in Jinja
Okay,  I too enjoyed it in Jinja last week
That's cool
That Perch is the best to eat among Ugandan fish species <This message was edited>
And the Mmale, is it the catfish or lungfish <This message was edited>
I think lung fish is the Mmale
Yeah, that thing is so good <This message was edited>
Yeah.
It's flesh is so soft
The friends you make today is what your kids will see as connections in future when you are no more so know who make friends and who to ignore in life
*#Noise Maker*
Especially you 😂😂😂😂
Just be my friend if you don't want more war in Uganda coz I will produce too many rebels 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

If you wanna make noise
In that last 4 seasons what does Arsenal have 😂
Show us the trophies you have
Don't tell us you play good every season <This message was edited>
Which position are you

Is your team in champions
We are pushing the Agenda, it doesn't matter if we don't have anything
Wow.
Nope
Wow
Then you know where you fall
Do you have any champions League trophy
Is your team in FA
That's Amorin there, imagine 10hug never reached there <This message was edited>

Whenever Arsenal sees trophies it loses appetite for playing ball
Europa
Weigh Europa and champions
At least man utd sucked ten hug with 2 trophies and 4 finals
This people with lame, leg cut off blind deaf dumb excuses 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are still with Mike with good playing style
Anti for us it's sure for you not even gona reach semi

We're not like Man U breaking records of 1890🤣😂😂
That's what you have always told us
For the last 20yrs
We're the Arsenal 💪😎😷
It's not records of 1890
Let's put a from 2005 till now
Or even 2010
What do you guys have
We're playing psv next, u know that's a win, then you will know who is who after us beating Madrid 😅
That makes sense that man utd doesn't have

Big meets big
Arsenal 😂
Arsenal and Barca
A u ready to cry dat night 🏟
Ahhh, I can't
Arsenal Supporter have big dreams and less intentions

Thank you for reminding them
Its good for the club but we fans are very annoyed with the current performance
We are targeting champions league here
Like good playing style which has taken you now where
And who has a good performance now
We the unbeaten team in Europe (PSG) and  our Barcelona
It's so exciting just to see a team playing good, when did Man U last do that 😅
We're in England, we are coming for Barca soon
But at least we have trophies in the last 3 yrs
Ok but I go for Liverpool still
So which one is good playing good with no trophies and bad play with trophies
So the whole topic is about trophy
Yes what else do you want to show us
Talk about something else
Tell us what you have in the last 10 yrs and we show you too
Football is about winning trophies thats what   makes  history
I have turned the Channel to watch the opponents Man UTD will face next season but Sunderland is losing to Hull City again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤔🙌
Bruno makes 2-1
When we start to talk about trophies @256779025158 you have kept quiet 🤐

Come back its 2:2 now
Penalty for Everton
VAR check

Anti ts a ka goal to arsenal fans buh eventually t turned out to b a goal
Arsenal Supporter: we shall win the trophies these season
Arsenal team: we listen we don't judge 😂
We are unbeaten in the whole of Europe even @256777779815 knows

And Champions League
Ts oky, i no longer support football buh i had to
Dream
Never
😅😅😅😅
But I have my unbeaten and even @256709780347 will suffer
Oooooh
Am waiting for them
Westham was full of harm! If there were any doubts, relegation candidates have shown that no team plays without strikers. I hope Mr Know-It-All has learnt. When everybody thought the team.needed a striker before the January Window, that little midget, Arteta arrogantly had what he called better ideas! Westham has put paid to his title pretence. Price of primitive arrogance. <This message was edited>
I remember they beat us the Mama Esther United also
Obadde kyi? Linda ko
Our season has ended. We wait for another and the cycle goes on.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ojjakukiwuliraa 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for the confirmation 😂
I have already heard it. It wont come twice. Eeeh mpola mpola.
Arsenal Oyeeee.💪💪💪💪💪
We shall remain the Arsenal 💪😎💪
Absolutely.
The losers
Yeah. Regardless we move, though lero kiganye
We're winners in our own dimension
A loss is part of a game just like a win or draw
Yes. Next time better
Nawe towangaaza a small slip up. We gonna gerri up. U know!
Wc one🤣🤣🤣
Today is done. We now focus on tomorrow
Even tomorrow u will lose , infact we r tired of you destroying our betting tickets
🤣🤣🙌🙌
My bro why do you bet
It hasn't yet ended sir, we still have hope
But you know the drill
Yet City will be the one to win?
That one can't try even
The drill?
If they beat Liverpool tomorrow
I wish they best Pool
Now see for you win you expect others to loose
So if the don't loose you won't see a trophy 🏆
They are on calculations now 😁😁😁😁
Yah
Even you,  you are calculating not to end up in the last three positions 😅
Thats true bro 😁😁😁
You can now see levels, we in struggle for the trophy and you are in struggle not to cut u off😅
We are fearing playing that Plymouth who beat Liverpool next season 🤣🤣🤣
Hehehe
Playing those people is not easy
There was a group of people praying for Liverpool to loose so that they can get a trophy 🏆
@256779025158 ,@256782470261 and @256767475239
Manchester City 0-2 Liverpool 🥳🥳🥳
I thout i knew this alone😂😂😂
Who wanted pool to lose
Do u know praying when u know u were cursed 😂😂
Stop pretending 😂😂😂we shall not beat u..just accept
Not pretending, we lost yesterday and counting on our next match
We're the Arsenal 💪💪😎
The whole world knows u lost??...but accept today u wanted Liverpool to be in the same boat
I know football well and understand that a team's success is contributed by its efforts
True...
But first accept today Liverpool's loss was your happiness...we want u to first accept and then tell us other things
We're the Arsenal 💪😎
We are the team that takes nothing every season 🥹
You will regret your words
When you take nothing
Being are fan of that club is like staying with a woman who doesn't produce enwe good evening to everyone here
We're the Arsenal 💪😎😎
Its still one guys you have hearts you produce nothing every year
We're the Arsenal 😷😷😷😎
Always grabbing attention of small boys 😁
We really appreciate your research about the Big Club
You lough when others haaaaaaaaa
It's only Liverpool the big club ... others are small territories
All those in the lower table are small territories 😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣
How about those who win nothing every season...are they also big??
Of course.
The fact that Arsenal is your point of discussion........
It's a big club
i thought @256782470261 was the man for us🥲
# Politics

I will eat him
I'm , do u want to follow me
Naye stop lying bro 😂😂🙌
Aate hw
I can not do that
You can't eat my coz your tribe don't do that
It's u lying , seboo we were in p7 in 2016 ,u guys were speaking of pps
Hahah
🤣🤣🙌
That was the year which the best games were played 😁😁😁
Hahahaha , sports
Analissist
yeah those days if you played a lost in the field you are not allowed to play a lost when going back to your school and the host was never allowed to lose 😂😂😂
Eeeh MN
That was what the fixtures were based on even Kibuli and St. Mary's College Kitende know that
MN fr us in side country E  Peter's college never lost weather it's home or away
Guys always carried slashers in the bus
Including your yesterday's weapon with ball bearings 😂😂😂
Hahaha
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mn just know red top was always the solution
Yeah but the players were always disciplined bot the fans 🤣🤣🤣
But now days it's small small kids joining secondary
Those frogs can't even lead a stick
That's the issue mn
yeah and some districts do make it to be played on a neutral ground which is not for secondary schools
They fair wahala basing from the history of most schls mn
The theory was that "the more fans you bring the further you will go in the competition"
yeah
😂🤣😂
But ours don't used to go with fans but they were being supported by another school
In all our matches , the ref could always run away in 80s  as long as they are leading our school 🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️ so we would play until we win
Eeeh
Mine way single , so all boys used to be in the Field
Then you people were like Express of last season 😂😂
Weather u class has gone or not  u have to be in the field with at least a stick on ur hand towards the end of the match
Just kno
We always had penalties in fast half as our opening goals
Just I miss stricks mn
Even mine was single with only less than 100 girls in A Level and whenever the district says our school was going to host it the HM just say if hosting Athletics and Rugby we will but Football better rule our names out coz we will leave you to participate alone 😅😅
Guy was always scared
Ours we only pick the ball which passes near the post and put it in the net and the goal must even be counted
yeah
Eeeh
Ate those schls without nets suffered most
Coz we will be having the school which is feared as part of our fans coz they were also single 😂😂
yeah
Mu car ma
U guys were wrong
But when we are supposed to be drawn against them, the head of competition who was from our school will be given the task to use his power to change the opponents
😂😂😂 u were thugs at the same time
Like fr real bro
yeah but since we were having two big teams between us, he must make sure that one is knocked out before quarter finals so that changing the opponents be easy
Eeeh
I sports teacher should be in prison I'm sure if he continued with those acts
They used to support his team coz when that school bring machineries he will allow them to play
He is still there upto now but in a different school but @256740908112 knows him better
MN fr us no machineries but we always won , it was a MUST
This Uncle
hey we still live hitting your evening songs one by one just tap the link🥰🤞
But he don't used to allow our school to have machineries coz he knows how to cheat but he never won any tournament but always used to finish in no.2, no.3 and no.4
Arsenal
😂😁🥹🤣
Like fr real by bro
yeah he used to say his mission was only to reach Regional tournament but he won before we joined there
That's now man u
But for us we were good at nationals
It won those days back
Sure, wat school bro
Yeah and that was the only history he used to rely on when ask 😁😁😁
Jinja SS
That's man u fr sure
Lucky you
Eeeh mn u guys beat us one time wen came fr friendlies both football and basketball but we acted humble
We're the Eastern Giants
@256761860938 and @256761519858 come for him 😂😂😂
We gave you 9 goals to nil
Where
MN u dogs are bad in basketball
@256761860938 is papa Manchester United while @256761519858 is mama Manchester United
Just know We're the Mighty School
I hear
They are still in the Fulham ❤️ break
Yeah they thought they were going to resurrect yesterday but they even failed to do it and they are waiting for @256767475239 and his team to visit them
Man that's a draw or win for the first team to score
MN let fast iron tomorrow church
Which team will be that to score first?
Either Man U or Arsenal
The first to score will win.
ok
Hahajja

Sap man
U are not speaking
Haaa h
Someone with information let us know... Shall we have lectures tomorrow??
Some of us are spending transport to come to school for no cause..
So sorry about that bro.  Buh no option...come tomorrow, we shall sort out the rest from their. Your physical presence matters a lot
That's cool.
We shall be there
Sorry
Sorry. The school opened and learning effectively commenced. It is unfortunate some classes may not have had lecturers or even good student numbers to warrant holding classes.
My humble advise to you is that when you reach school and no lecturer shows up, use that time to get course outlines, existing study materials for some or all the courses. Sit down preferably in the library and read. Learning takes varied forms including being without lecturer. Do research. Discuss  how to prepare better this semester. See what it is you can do to improve your CGPA. It may not be profitable to come to school and just go back unless one does it for recreational value
Thnx sir but wats CGPA in full🤷
Cumulative Grade Point Average
Cumulative Grading Point Average... something close to that 😅
It is short form of Cumulative Grade Point Average. It is a system.used to weigh a students performance over the duration of their study. The highest can be 5.0 meaning the student scored only As. 4.5 and above is first class.
Correct.
How it is.computed is not material for whatsapp.
👌👌
Hello guys
@256782470261 is tomorrow worth coming because we invest in transport and there are no lecturers
And also wen r our results coming back
Anko 😂😂😂
Coz now it’s two weeks past the announced date
Wanjiii papa
We have to be their
Sir not in bad faith but even last week we were there but u saw what happened so is it worth please
I will be there..so be there too😂😜🏃‍♀️
Tomorrow we will attend.
You and who 🫵
And those who value time.
If you valued it you would be resting now
Time is money , value each and every minute, a sleeping dog.....
Up to now u can't differentiate between sleeping and resting 🙌🙌🙌🤣
They're different things
Get me well that's a saying it has a hidden meaning, go research and next time try to think out the box
I understand it well and that's why I told you there's a difference btn resting and sleeping
It's contextual
Then we meet tomorrow if so
I'm always there .
It's rather, meet me there 🤣
Good morning folks

Campus is still okay but hurry coz your group members are in for lectures
_No need for you to tell him sorry I even told him before!_
Bro my TOEyota had no fuel that's why I'm late
I am even knowing that bro
Okay .
But thank God I loaded it and it's now full tank
But hurry
Ok that's good

Let's make it a point to submit the assignment before 1pm....inform all your friends who might not see this message🙏🏻
Group B lectures in room 2.
Guys some free lunch

Location, ku MUBs😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
Who's free we go there 😁
Ffe we already there😂
First secure some one  seat.
Let me hurry

Am already in
The bad thing I am fasting rice
I have 5 seats for my friends 🤣🤣🤣
But have they confirmed lunch, because we're having lent and Ramadan
Not everyone are doing the same 😂😂😂🙌
Good bro.
Just keep them. Let me contact one more mercenary
Okay
I'm seeing serving tables organized already 😂
But contact only the serious guys
Alright
Okay. Then it's a sure deal
I have a  Hitman.
Let me hope so
He knows no rice amount, he finishes anything in front of him
Yet am having 2 plates now 😂
Yeah. He's better than both of us
Ok
Bro don't finish pilau 🤣
I can't finish it be4 you arrives here bro 😂😂😂 instead am still loading more 🤣🤣🤣 <This message was edited>
Okay. I trust you in loading. 🤣
I'm bringing our container for loading supper
But must be these jackets leballed I love football 😂😂😂🙌
Exactly, as we did last year 🤣🤣
I'm also coming with appetite giving tablets
Yeah
I was almost forgetting to tell you that 😂😂😂🙌
I remembered, because it saved us last year
Yeah
But won't they arrest us like last year at UICT during handover <This message was edited>
This is MUBS not UICT 😂😂😂🙌
Okay. But there's a police station at MUBS . If they start asking for IDs , it will end in joy 😂😂
Am still a fresher 🙈🙈
Which program
I remember you told them ITB 😂😂😂 today am for DCS 😂😂😂🙌
🤣🤣😂
This time I'm for DEEE
Then me for DECE 😂😂😂🙌
Get ready for Batoon 🤣😁🙌
Yet they have not yet given me?
Is chicken still enough
Because I'm here at Nakawa market
Even beyond enough coz most people are fasting
Then hurry
Okay.
But bro you have taken too long
It's a long story bro
Just in tears😭
Ok I know they have arrested you now
Are you in Police station?
That's it bro
Under the police pickup truck 🛻
ive received countless slaps
I was even guessing coz you can never disappoint
All these is as a result of @256754752322 informing you about free lunch at MUBS 🤔🤔🤔
Bro come and save me. These guys are tough.
Man that's the root cause. They're asking for national ID, yet I have for South Sudan
I can not come coz they have arrested me here that I have eaten too much of their food and there is no way I can come out
Thats again just worsening the situation
Then we're finished. Have they locked you up <This message was edited>
Bro just know I'm in deep trouble
Thats obvious but when they were taking me in I thought they also have their HUB which we were heading to but we ended up going to the room which I dont even know the name
Am even knowing
Bro let's pray hard. Otherwise people are laughing at me " look at him, he's from Sudan"
And to make matters worse, I've been asked where I was heading and replied MUBS. then was asked again MUBS in full, and I said " My Uganda Built Stronger".
I received a strong slap and my left eye is now blinking rapidly
You started failing too early
Yeah.
They've said we're heading to Luzira, is it a beach or Restaurant
That place is where Besegiye is being kept
🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆
I'm finished.
Bro let me start crying loudly so they can release me
Do so
I haven't recovered from this
Why?
Very bad
Bro the pickup is heading to Luzira.
That I will receive the full package from there
Port Bell road
Yes, we've passed by  MUBS
And I've seen tents and heard some music
Upnext Mbuya Military Barracks
Bro we've branched at  the CMI headquarters
Bad news
Yeah .
I'm seeing guys in black with masks. Holding bamboo sticks
They will beat you massively
My right ear is already off.
ok but stay humble
Bro there's no way of staying humble
They've again told me : "panda gari"
That we're heading to Luzira
We may meet there if they decide to take me also
Okay bro.
But they've asked me why I left Sudan and I have no answer
Then they promised to break my forehead head
very bd in excess
Yeah
At 4:30 they're breaking my phone
Mine is 4:20
Then goodbye bro
We meet in Luzira Prison
Tis is my last message let me hope we will be in the same station
Hopefully bro.
Nice beatings and slaps 😂
Good evening comrades any java Community
Bro you've suffered a lot. Didn't you try the other group
Man the community u connected me with bali balimu bya luxury, not yet got any Jv com
😂🤣🤣
Bro it's not luxury.
Just trust the process
wat was it kati am trusting it no worries
Lets start ours
Yaa that's a good idea but are u versed with the lang. I wanted to  interact with people who are far better than me such that I can get to know my mistakes
👍👍
Get tutorials from competent sources
And maybe utilize GitHub
Problem solving and stack overflow is key
Yeah
tutorials aren't enough
But those prominent sources offer problem solving strategies through assignments, projects
Unfortunately I interact with those of other languages. But I think even for Java is there
But my advice is, create a group and invite serious members, then get someone who's a professional, to guide and mentor members
Have your Girlfriend received hers? 😂😂😂🙌
She's stingy man. 😂🤣🤣🙌
She doesn't want a car 😂😂😂🙌
I'm convincing her to send money so she can win a car. But she's hard, telling me that she's gonna plait hair tomorrow <This message was edited>
I can see she wants to die while driving TOEyota 😂😂😂🙌
Bro just know she likes TOEyota so much. 🤣😂😂🙌🙌
Yet I'm tired of that vehicle
Even me am tired of it 😂😂😂🙌
At least I will upgrade to Mercelegs Benz
Lets upgrade together but must be next week 😂😂😂🙌🙌
Yeah. We shall visit Spear Motors on Monday and get the machines

But is your driving license still valid
Of course yes
That's great. Me too.
At least we shall leave TOEyota and enjoy Mercelegs Benz. 😂🤣🤣🤣🙌
Thats it
Bro my girlfriend has finally sent money and is now demanding for the vehicle.
I've told her to contact MTN and she's threatening me 🤣
Thats bad news but tell her that MTN was recommending MoMo App not USSD code 😂😂🙌
Ok. That's a good excuse. But she has said that tomorrow is a day . I think I'm finished 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌
English has suffered in Tanzania
You cant bro 😂😂😂
Yeah
She's now asking me to return the pair of stockings she bought me 🤣🤣
Bad news

Anha so!?!

So we have to help Meta find usefulness in their new feature.

I hope he will not come back again 😂😂😂😂🙌
Seems you are just excited to use that but we’ve seen it before
Am also like that 😆😆
Yeah but how will Meta know that it's working when we fail to use it?
He's just acting as a history student. Features are developed for use. ,
Good enough am here with you who did engineering 😂😭😂😂😂

Which is okay.

Not knowing that when buying using Airtel money they do give 25% bonus
Yeah.
And MTN is offering vehicles for transactions from female accounts to male accounts
But only 3 have got theirs by now

Yeah
null
null
Meta have told us to try whether all their WhatsApp features are working well
That's it. .
And we have to help find bugs in the feature
So you have no solution please 🫵
Yeah you first tag again
Ok bro . Just a moment
Ok am waiting for it
null
I'm done bro
Have already seen it bro
Okay
You also tag bro. We keep the feature working well .
Let me tag later am a bit busy texting some people
Ok bro.
why tag someone you don't even know?🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Uict collected many pipo from different backgrounds and societies… so let them explore Kampala and its features
Which is okay.
You're just rigid and not willing to embrace change .
And perhaps you don't know the purpose of meta's new feature development
But I know you
Why was that feature added there if its useless?
Calm down bro even someone from your home which is in forest can still use WhatsApp to tag the group
And the other thing, the status doesn't open itself. You have a decision. Don't act like illiterates please
That's it.
He's just backward
Thinking that technology is stagnant
Tell him he is thinking that he is to wise but instead he might have taken some weed now 🤔🤔🤔
A point😂
That's it. And perhaps he didn't read the new documentation of WhatsApp. He's just there to act as illiterates  .
Calm down my dear
We even have to share for him that file
Please I will take you through the main reasons for adding the like feature for status, group tagging and everything
Yeah. Because he deserves to do diploma in History
So backward.
He's a goon
With the other man called @256708855210 😁😁😁😁🙌
He's one of those people who think that post office is better than emails
Yeah. They are in this group by mistake
Yeah
Lets called the admins to see them 😂😂😂😂😂🙌
The one thing that hurts me most, someone tags you, only to findout it's some stupid stuff. What's the irony behind that?
But your phone can not open that status by itself so you must also better style up
Sometimes back when we started using WhatsApp, it was fake.
But now it's a good place to stay, especially for growing businesses where people can generate ads that lead to Facebook, Instagram and then statuses that engage a large number of people.
Such people deserve to throw away smartphones and use button phones only .
Actually. We should carry out an operation to find out whether everyone here is from DCS
I think it’s enough for today
Are you forced to open.
Don't act immature 🫵
That's it. He should learn to make informed decisions
Yes that's true because someone can tag you for a reason. But there are some fools that be seeking attention from everyone.
@256782470261 should handle that caes very soon
*Then you go and sleep!*
Yeah
Good night then
The greatest fool is that who opens and comes shouting for people 🤣🫵
Actually he should take enough water to restore sense
Then sleep
Better dont use the word fool if you dont want to view the status just continue scrolling without opening it it and you will never complain any more
You call it shouting... I call it teaching🧠
But must be cold water coz the one usually call tea is too bad
Yeah
Thea some groups u don’t need to show that ur local sell ur fons woofers to those pipo in the village group this is a DCS @ Uict grup
Post a laptop we shall appreciate
Indeed thats @256707008256 😂😂😂😂😂🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵
But there are people requesting to buy phones at the campus
Thea is the dcs freedom
The @256707008256 your bed is waiting for you 😁😁😁😁😁🙌
Take some cold, in fact add little salt then drink . You will be well and finally rest
I hope here is DCS freedom also coz there are no lecturers here?
Muzitembeye nga abanyarwanda ba screen guard
Post we don’t have words for u
Yeah. And this is the definition of e-commerce. Not only Amazon, Jumia , Glovo do it. Anyone can start simple
Then just go and look for your bed or you have already urinated on it?
It's already wet.  🤣🤣🤣
Yeah
Wetdream 😁😁😁🙌
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
😂😂😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
The fact that you're tagging a status means you want attention
From people who don't know you
Be mindful because not everyone is interested
If you are failing to see our  side of it
Then...........
I surely expected this😅😅🙌
These two are putting in a lot of sense to speak nonsense 🫴🫴
I have always seen u you like a person with a bit higher reasoning capacity but the ruckus ur causing is making me see u as a #### in my head <This message was edited>
Fst deal with ur idiocy then attack others ….
Call him 😁😁😁🙌
He should just sleep now 🤣🙌
Am seeing like that also 😂😂😂😂🙌
I pity you 🤌🏿🤌🏿🤌🏿🤌🏿😂😂😂
At this point I've got nothing to prove...I've just realised it's only a few guys trying to showcase their inborn talent of being obtuse fulltime...You can go on guys it's a free world🙌🙌
And I'm proud of myself. Sense is not measured in hypocrisy.
I'm true to myself.
Always open.
So ur a proud #### 🤌🏿🤌🏿😂😂
I know myself and gat no time to prove. Call me whatever you want . But just know what I do , you can't . Trust me.
I'm just open and easy.
What you do I can’t coz I can’t be a ####🤣🤣🤣🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
The difference btn me and you is that I don't pretend to be high. I'm just easy. And keep everything simple
That's what you cannot do .  - yet I live it
# Call me whatever you want
@256709431540 have you also started?
*Come on board if you want more!*
I wanna teach you something today.
Never pretend to be high.
# Stay humble.

@256763126678 you're sorted tomorrow 😊😊
Btw are you a woman? 😂😂
I will put on the dress but let me hope lectures will not be there 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
I'm in
I knew you were going to come in 🤣🤣 I trust my boys
Will boys be allowed
Why not?
Surely I can't miss that food
We shall make sure they are allowed 😉 😏... to comfort the women 😊😊
We will start from Breakfast
That's injustice 🥹🥹🤣
Exactly 💯
Men are also welcomed
This is good news
Let me prepare my appetite pills
Eeeh I knw u wen t cams to eating...
Eating is a must
Yeah
Can I carry some appetizer for my friend @256767475239 ?
You carry bro 😄
Am carrying it bro
That's great
This night I will take the appetite giving tablets
Me am still going to the drug shop to look for mine
Brooo go slow 🐌 😒 we are looking forward to only providing some little refreshments 😊😊
Change of plan 😹
But we should come when ready for the battle coz people may be in a small number and the food may just be wasted 🤣🤣🤣
Okay . 2k will be enough to get the full dose
We shall not accept that.
🤣
That's it. And ladies can't eat well
Yet am there with only 5k 🤔🤔🤔
That will work well
Yeah but remember for us in group B we have some Muslims who are fasting like @256705754496 the assistant coordinator and will get the food and bring to me 😂😂😂🙌
🤣🤣🤣
What if they use it for Iftar
I hope they will not think like that and I have to first notify her as early as possible 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah. That will work well
But who will help us get breakfast
And am waiting for the reply from her now 🤣🤣🤣
We will go there by ourselves bro
She should give assurance
Yeah 😂😂
But who will help us with dresses
But she is taking too long to reply 🤔🤔🤔
That's a big worry for us
@256765443804 said even men will be allowed thats why am not looking for the dress 🤣🤣
Okay 🤣🤣🤣🤣
But by morning I hope my reply will be ready
😂😂😂
We just wait but remember to carry the bucket labeled I Love Football ⚽
Hopefully.
Nothing shall fail. We shall go and assist in Photography
If I miss the food there make sure you will take me to your hostel 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah, it's ready bro , with Messi's sticker
😂😂🤌
Thats what we will be staring in 🤣🤣🤣🙌
Thats very good 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah. Then we shall even help with the projector, connecting computers😂🤣🤣
Yeah 😂😂
But am not seeing breakfast
Does it mean I should come at midday? 🤔🤔🤔
Thats what the AR will even thank us for 😂😂😂🙌
Surely 😄😄
That's the plan now. Because without breakfast the central government will complain
But will the security allow us to enter with the Bucket?
If they refuse we will smuggle it from that side where Hillary stays 😂😂😂
But the Breakfast is ever upon the arrival and they will send us direct to under the tent after the arrival 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They can't refuse the 🪣. We shall put some plates as if we're among the catering staff
Yeah 🤣
Thats the good idea or we just pretend and put some half a kilo of posho and we pretend to be among those residing in the school hostel and we are just from Nakawa market 😂😂😂 and we went there to buy some food stuffs 🤣🤣🤣
Exactly 🤣🤣
We should also include tomatoes and onions 🧅
@256765443804 can you prepare or us the list we register as the men going to attend the function 🤣🤣🤣
Thats it 🤣🤣🤣
Surely he should sort us Early
Yeah. Let me buy salt now and we also include it 🤣
Just know I am there for the boy child
Yeah 🤣🤣🤣
Can I prepare the list here?
But dont forget to curry the Tomato Sauce 🤣🤣🤣
It's readily available bro. 🤣
Ok then
Yeah
Guys let's meet tomorrow
Ok but let me hope they are now preparing juice for us who can not take tea for Breakfast 🤣🤣🤣🙌
In the morning for the boy child to be safe 😂 <This message was edited>
😂😂😂
Yeah
Alright 🤣🤣🤣
U will fall down
And i won't help u
Not at all
Kale gwe...
Ok but dont forget to be in the HUB tomorrow
A u woman....
Surely . We must eat
Even men are called
There wil b free food for mainly women

Mine is almost 2 times bigger than that
What if you get a retake in it?
It's big bro
Ok we will go with those 2 like that
man skill is all i seek, basically skill. ebisigande not so relevant
But you have to perform in all of them
true
i need to
It's important
*The ones who designed the program structure did consultations sir.... do more research on that your thesis*
yeah
it is because we are not learning, atleast other lecturers have shown up but not that one. thats why i was wondering
Worry not sir..
All will be well
*🚨🚨🚨🚨BREAKING NEWS*
*LUNCH LOADING IN THE HUB*
*_COME ONE COME ALL_*
Right...
Its about only 1 hour to time
I'm bringing the 🪣
We should be good time keepers
You hurry
Thats it
Yes bro
Have you reached near Common Room?
I'm at MUBS
Now entering the gate
Ok am waiting for you near the common room
Am seeing you with the white bucket
Now let's go enter
yeah but we should be at that side of the field
Yes bro. But I'm smelling the aroma of chicken
It seems everything is ready
Even me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am seeing the serving points also
Yeah
There's hope. Even my enzymes are now happy 😊
Am taking the appetizer now
Me too. I overdosed on the appetite tablets
And I may clear 4 plates
Even me
I will try to play with 10 plates today
But I won't carry you back home 🤣🤣🤣
I will only task you to carry all the 2 buckets 🤣🤣🤣🙌
Bro I can't manage to carry that food alone . It will be heavy
I remember the other time we used a boda boda because the rice was heavy
Dont worry we will get a bodaboda
And its what we will do today again
Yeah
How will we transport the soda 🥤
I don't know
Or we hire a taxi for today?
The taxi won't be allowed inside
We should hire a Tuku Tuku
ok
Thats even a better option
Yes
I see some catering staff carrying dishes. Maybe time is soon
only about 14mins
Yes
But juice is missing
I see only soda and Nivana
They have replaced it with soda
we will carry about 5 cartons of soda especially MIRINDA whether fruity or apple
Yes. And Mirinda is the dominant brand
Followed by sprite
Am even seeing
But Nivana is also in abundance
Yeah
I'm not seeing tooth picks. How will we remove beef pieces from our teeth
But we dont want water 💦
Yeah.
We should consider Mirinda
yeah
👍
I'm now badly off. the programs coordinator should consider lunch
we wait we are left with 5 mins only
Yeah, but the appetite tablets have started reacting
Not from your side only
Man they're tough. Let me first talk to the lady in pink, she's among the catering team
Lets go together wait for me at the door side there
Alright bro. She's here , u hurry up
Am here just behind you now and we can go
Alright
but lets just be texting so that she can think that we are not friends
Yeah bro. That will work
yeah
She is offering soda as we wait for food . Which type do you like
f course MIRINDA
I've told her Mirinda fruity and Apple
Can I have the hope of a full carton? my bag is only waiting
Let me consult
ok
That we should wait after serving, they will give us
ok let me stay humble now
Okay bro. But meanwhile we will keep on taking one bottle at a time as we wait for our carton
She had offered Nivana but I refused
Lets enjoy although we are not among the gender celebrating
Even me I was going to refuse
Yeah. The Bible says that many are called but few are chosen
She has called us to help her carry tables
Let's Go
Exactly
They are ready
Am coming
Yeah.
I see dishes with food being prepared
Will she give us one full dish?
Yes, after carrying. But she  will give us the one of Irish
But I want the one for chicken <This message was edited>
That one won't be possible to get now
ok ow lets take Irish like that
Yeah
But that one is mostly for young kids but we have to take like that and exchange from the shop
Okay .
I will take it to my son
Let me give you this sprite
Not even bad
I will take that one now
Yep
Alright

When you see us silent like this just know eating is going on
Exactly
yeah
But the chicken is classic.

U mean they were still alive 🤣😂😂🤣😂

But men because they are not giving food now you resort to leaving
For us we have taken soda already with @256767475239

But you also hurry
We're okay. The stomachs are doing wonderfully
Colleagues, food will come

You will please take me through what was covered today 🙏
C programming is very easy guys

It just requires time
You deserve a prison
After reading through
That's the only option
Come and take me

C is easy if one labors to understand from the grassroots
Exactly.
I will still continue telling them like that
@256767475239 he is talking of prison 🤔🤔🤔
Yeah.
Yeah. Not knowing that .........
I'm not talking about programming
Don't complete it
You mean Hardware, alright. When should I come
I won't
Ok
I don't think I'm in the position to teach right now
*AS YOU ARISE*
If someone is doing better than you at this time, that doesn't mean you are failing. It only means you are at another point in your journey. You will receive what you are meant to receive at the right time, in the right circumstances. Let others' wins inspire you to aim higher.
*Wishing you a successful week*
Alright
Thanks Mr.
When the lectures is nice time do move very fast I don't even know why
But C programming was going very well
Welcome back from the lecture

*Road Safety Alert* 🚨
Good morning, everyone.
Heavy flooding has affected roads across Kampala this morning.
If a road is known to flood during heavy rains, assume it is impassable—do not take the risk.
⚠️ *Safety Measures for Driving in Flooded Conditions:*
* Avoid flooded roads. You cannot accurately judge the depth or strength of the water.
* Do not drive through moving water. Even shallow currents can sweep vehicles away.
* Keep your hazard lights on to increase visibility to other drivers.
* Reduce speed and increase following distance to avoid skidding.
* Stick to the middle of the road where flooding is often shallower.
* Watch out for submerged potholes and open manholes.
* If water reaches your car’s exhaust, turn off the engine immediately to avoid stalling and damage.
* Motorcyclists and pedestrians should take extra caution as they are more vulnerable to strong currents.
* If in doubt, turn around. It’s safer to find an alternative route than to risk getting stuck.
All road users should exercise caution and patience this morning. If possible, delay travel until conditions improve.
Stay safe. ⚠️
Now after rain which lecture
Hahaha 🤣😂🤣🤣

remember ur CDF requested for the fight with H.E Bobi Wine and it was approved so concentrate on karate and kungu fu since u wont use guns in this displinary fight
That fight won't be there.
Those guys are kidding
CDF can't do that shit naawe,,,what if He loses, what can He tell His father
Exactly bro,,,,MK just tweets to gain following
UPDF can't also allow him to do so.
That's it.
And he wants to be the point of discussion always
He will be degrading himself,,he can't do it
Exactly,,,he always tweets nonsense
That's it.
But make sure I don't forward this message to him 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂 Just buying him beer and he forgets,, that's easy
😂😂😂😂
Remember I'm a JAT operator and can easily locate you.
I'm seeking  promotion. So I will impress him at your expense
Continue brother,, let me sacrifice myself for your promotion
Alright
Normalize reading documentation, fellow developers,so as u can solve errors....

Negativity is enough but don't wish bad🤧

They are friends
De-colonize your perception of the lecturer, you'll enjoy 😊
Friends from the same century almost

No lectures today?
The lecturer is already in the lecture room

Wayforward now
As who
Patience pains but pays
Please I got communication that there is no lecture from big man
We need authentic information
who is the big man
As who
Rep🤣😂
Bro
In the first place , have you eaten
Supply for today if you need to Supply food today
First answer the question appropriately 🤣🤣
I expect yes or no
Which answers do you need 🤣😂
👆👆
Sorry for you 🤣😂🤓😎
But did you go for today
In Spirit, I was there
Gwe byakulemye ......  Byenakubuziza
Yo
👆👆👆
Did u see my question
Man I am totally green about Java. So I can't tell why it hasn't run as you wanted
But the account is for professional development and hence can do everything
But then the other issue is that since you're involving a real email address, it can't work out because you're not using a live IP address for a server but a local host which I think can't help  achieve your goal. It requires an IP address of a real server or domain name. Because the Google servers have to get communication with your server so as to retrieve the OTP
Izzzeee
Naye banaye,
And that is how we small boys at some point we will be called big men , seating in those sits of really big men , we trust the process
Surely .
Y not brother we just keep pushing, though I pity those in their comfort zones , stranded ,bambi confused, but we try out our best to keep encouraging them as we put them in our prayers
That's it.
When a friend loses hope , track, and direction, it's the responsibility of those watching to correct and realign the colleague.
Because no one knows tomorrow. You never know someone will become your in-law, work mate, and/ or even a boss.
Your right my g, but tomorrow is today, wat u do today reflects tommorrow
Everyday should be an opportunity to push forward regardless of the distractions and shortcomings .  That's why even the fingers are of different lengths. And each has a key role. Without the thumb, you can't lift a Jerry can.  Team work is the key and cooperation is the way forward.
Exactly. Tomorrow is simply the next minute or hour.
So when u get a brooo of track grab him with force and then onto the track
That's it. And that's what I always do with my buddies .
Encouraging them to take action immediately. Because where there's action, there's progress
Ur good man, wat of these baby gals of ours , do u have a word for them
They should focus on personal and professional development.
Let them not be deceived . Because from an informed point of view, class always attracts class and magnets can't be attracted by wood .
So our sisters should focus and aim higher.
Hello praise God,  fellas how are you,
Have today's supper in name  of Jesus christ
Read isaiah 54:17
There are weapons which people have forged men fought against you leave them to do so but the bible says no weapons fought against the enemy shall prosper.
God will not allow the enemies weapons to succeed when you continue serving God in truth and righteous. The God will have to uproot what he never planted in you much as they may plant everything they want but trust me or not God's word doesn't lie is 💯💯perfect. Read this and meditate about it and pray that God gives you the protection where by no enemies shall be touch you
What a point, class attracts class, and money is power , focus and aim higher.
Amen
Yeah.
And in IT ladies have opportunities. They should utilize them because the world is moving at supersonic speed. And it waits for no one.
Those who know it know but all in all time wasted will never be gain , in this work hard, pray , have fun but stick to the plan only if u have, value some people around you who are promising, utilize those who are really good
That's it.
We should always remember that action is the best way to go.
Good morning colleagues,
It is with great sadness that we inform you that our brother @256753213400 this  morning lost his father who  was in the hospital for the past one month. We kindly request your prayers and support during this difficult time. May he rest in peace 🕊️🕊️🕊️
Hello my friends
I will be absent for the entire week
I have lost my beloved daddy this early morning ,,,l will let u know about the burrial preparations in the group very soon ,,,
Just pray for me please
Oh dear,  may God comfort you in these tough times
🥹🥹🥹may God strengthen you in this trying moment...may your dad RIP🙏🙏🙏
SO SORRY ABOUT THE LOSS BAMBI. MAY THE ALMIGHTY STRENGTHEN YOU AND THE FAMILY. MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE
May his soul rest in peace and may the Lord comfort you
Ohh what a pity🥹
May his soul rest in perfect peace 🕊️
Bro these are factors of life so stay strong 🙏 en May his soul rest in peace 😭😭😭😭😭
it's really a pitty, MHSRP
Praise God brethren, I greet you all in name of the almighty God 1Corinthians 13:11
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man, I am done with childish ways and have put them aside.
Content 🖐📚:
I want all you in this platform who stand firm seeking afterthought word of God blessed.
There's what we are going to talk about differences between a child and an adult.
Apostle Paul talks about a child and the a child behaves from an adult.
When he was still a child he used to talk like  a child & now he's grown up reasons like an adult.
Let's start from his spiritual journey that's what he tries to explain to us about because when he was a child spiritual he thought about only persecution only but once he experienced spiritual encounter he nolonger reasons like a child.
There something you may see as a Christian as a wastage of time because you are a child spiritually but when grow up you will start reasoning as mature person. Continue reading that very chapter from 13:1---- you understand what it meant to you  as a believer of today. Stay blessed 🤓😎❤️‍🩹💯
May the almighty God comfort you
Sorry about this dear colleague, may God comfort you. And may his soul rest in eternal peace 🙏🏾
May the Almighty God comfort you
Sorry to our brother. May  his soul rest in eternal peace.
May His Soul find peace 🕊️ in Heaven 🙏
Mhsrip🕊️🕊️, May God strengthen him during this trying moment🙏🙏🙏🙏
May his soul rest in eternal peace.and may you find comfort in the memories,the love and the moments you have shared..RIP
May God strengthen brother and the family 🙏
So sorry for his loss
May the Good Lord comfort you and your family bambi 🥹🙏
May the almighty strengthen you bro
Sorry bro 😞 😔 😢

Then after he abused me 🙈🙈
one contacted me ov the same issue and I told him am the manager of mtn, he got scared
so @256705419903 is one of a kind
Those bafere are having old tactics. Let them consult from Indian scammers

Has she complained?
Bro easy

But he should correct it so that we know you well 😁😁😁
Guys u still at compass

It's better u make your own money
We went for food not money better stay humble did anyone ask you to give him or her your money?
*STAND WARNED!*
Yes, I got the key.
Food🫢
But the left over food is more delicious than the real food 🤤
Food is life coz it contains water 😂😂😂😂😂
Thats why I kept it even
Strongly warned
Yeah
That's it
What?
Just fight instead of warning people <This message was edited>
People are referring to @256768711875 here as a boy as well as a girl
Have this been worked upon?
yeah
Fighting is for gangsters, but learned people solve the the conflict instead
Yes.
Guyz Northerners want to blow up fights in the hub BABABYE IN REALITY
I will get him on Monday coz tomorrow he will not come to the campus
Since when did this foolery begin?
Has*
You should have also done so
I don't even know 🥺🥺
That waz real visible cheating
Consult your teacher of English bro
For me I went there only to see the edibles not anything else 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They should chill. I was absent that's why it has happened.
For me I chilled that stuff the moment my South Sudanese culture was abandoned
but anyways it has happened the winner was pronounced and the loser was pronounced
Who won
Westerners
Tuswala😭
But I don't know anything about the losers and the winners coz me combined with @256767475239 won the edibles 🥹🥹🥹
Haha
Thats where we do win from 👀👀
That's it.
I am not after English at this instance bro..... i am after the irregularity that happened.... English ain't our Language of identity... that's why i had to refer you bro...... no war,:
Yeah
@256763126678 this girl has failed to walk back home. She's over satisfied
No war ovk
I was just helping you correct ur error
Buh she got the phone🥲
Now the boda can not work coz she is too heavy lets call the Tuku Tuku again 😂😂😂
Thanks then ma bro...., easy but no need to correct English in Africa
Easy bro🤝
That's it.
Whoever capitalizes on English is still held by colonialism .
As long as none of us is English, communication should be based on the fact of expression and not proving
Yeah. I tried carrying her but I couldn't.
Maybe she will sleep at your place bro. Get somewhere else
Am travelling upcountry this night take her to your place 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
I can't take her because no transport means.
Call the Tuku Tuku guy to help me
I hope you have taken her coz am just travelling now
Y didn't u call me for that, I could have driven her home, I came in a car
Naye banage 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I took her to my place.
Wats wrong bro
Now I'm sleeping at my neighbor's place 😪
ok
iz she safe on yo side
I left the house for her.
You can not do that coz we don't truth you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
Naye nawe, how can u live her stay in yo house alone, u a being rude
Tell him the truth like that
Restructure yo grammar pliz
No.
I did the right thing
U can doubt but didn't u see a small Rav 4 at the parking lot, it was red, that's the one I drove with in
Yep
For us we're good people
If English is your mother tongue you rephrase it
That wasn't right, u would have left the bed for her instead and u sleep on the floor
It would violate her privacy
I don't have that time, koz am not the one who spoilt the grammar
Not really
Our level is above that but we dont want to show off just
That's it
That's the fact
Privacy is a must
Can I call for you someone here?
yeah
U can, am ready to face any one
Wat privacies
@256782470261 come here fo grammar complain
Anything wrong here
He was referring to singular not plural 😂😂😂😂
She is international neither rural nor urban
Okitegede
Next time take English to be normal 😂😂😂🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🙌
Kati what sort of grammar is this.
Yo sight is upside down
So u want me to bring the grammar ov hon mbidde
Its upto you coz you are the one who started 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌
Can you manage it yet this P.1 English is challenging you
Sincerely what's the meaning of this statement you made 👇👇
She is international neither rural nor urban
Exactly 😂
Y not, he iz the one I look up to
U can ask the available AI's for grammar check, its also an option to explain to u
Then let's switch to that grammar and I teach you well 🤣
Yeah 🤣🤣🤣
Accept you messed up.
Don't justify your nursery Errors 😂🤣
Really 😂🤣🤣🤣👇👇👇👇
She is international neither rural nor urban
U can pin it, I see it has become comedy
I'm gonna buy you English basics  (Oxford curriculum)
That's where real English is born. Otherwise you've learned a lesson
the major English iz spoken English, koz with written English, u can encounter some typing errors, but wen it comes to the side of oral English, there never think ov me trying to make any unnecessary mistake, koz I trust wat I speak
Mutandise Ku madam nkwanga haha
So u are against my TRUTH?
I'm not.
Alright u may rest abit and wake up for a new day 2moro seems yo brain iz exhausted
I'm simply based on the fact that written English is derived from spoken English.
One only gets to write something they're virtually speaking in their mind
Good night
Bye young man
Alright Jaja 🤣
Next tyme u will understand y its crucial to respect elders
I understood it the day my grandmother slapped me 😂
Ohhh that was y u will always get beatings from weak hands like from grandparents
My grandma is not weak.
She was a kick boxer.
Show me the awards she got through her career journey as a kick boxer
Unfortunately she didn't win awards
OK,  u can keep her history to yo self and those who know her, thanks
Because she lacked connections .
But one thing I can assure you is that her slap is hotter than ice 😁

*DEAR, MANCHESTER UNITED FANS BETTER PICK MY CALLS I WANT TO PAY YOUR DEBTS TONIGHT 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️*
🐇
Let me first breathe I come back kubanga🤦
FEEL THE POSITIVE PAIN
*For your information Manchester United was not only cooked by Newcastle but they were Baked, roasted, grilled, fried, boiled, steamed, heated, kitchen worked on, broiled, smoked, braised, stewed, simmered, deep-fried’ pan-fried, stir-fried, pressure cooked, slow cooked, oven cooked, micro-waved, pan-roasted, clay-pot cooked, oven roasted, cast-iron cooked, gas cooked, vacuum cooked, pickled, dehydrated, fermented and braised among others* 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
@256761519858 ,@256777779815 and the rest, come here
They're dying 😀😀
Let them die, they over yap😆😆😆
They were laughing at Arsenal's draw 🤣🤣🤣
Now they're wailing because of their loss 🤣🤣
Imagine Arsenal makes them happy and Man U creates tears for them 😍
Am listening to Kun Nya by king saha
🤣🤣🤣🤣
null
Listen to heartbreak songs 🤣🤣🤣
Send me this bro
and me 2
People always ask me how it feels to be a Manchester United fan let me answer you;
To be a Manchester United die-hard. It's more than just wearing the jersey or chanting our anthem. It's a way of life.
From the moment I fell in love with United, I knew I was part of something special. The legacy of Busby, Best, and Charlton. The dominance of Fergie's era. The magic of Beckham's crosses and Ronaldo's goals.
Being a United fan isn't just about winning – though, let's be honest, it's nice to lift those trophies! Mostly the champions League 😂 It's about the journey. The highs and lows. The nail-biting comebacks and crushing defeats. But defeats always make me cry 🤦😭😂
It's about the sense of community. The Red Army, united across the globe. Strangers become family, bonded by our love for the Red Devils.
I've cried, I've cheered, I've screamed at referees. But through it all, my passion for United remains unwavering.
We've faced dark days – the loss of our legends, the struggles on the pitch mostly the day David De Gea was hurt during the match. But we persevere, because that's what United fans do.
We are the proud, the loyal, and the dedicated. We are the voices that echo through Old Trafford. We are the heartbeat of Manchester United.
I really love Manchester United so much 😭 just know I can't leave without it
So here's to my fellow die-hards: let's keep the faith, let's keep believing. For United, we stand.
Glory, Glory, Manchester United!❤️🤗
Mazima
They are improving,it would have been 5 0 but never late

I don't know y for some reason I'm impressed with these guys hacking skills even if it's fraud
It depends which language are u doing for now???
C but I'm just impressed
Not even the language, those hackers are just good at intercepting stuff
Ohhh I feel you, so wat u do get the right language to do for hacking then Ur good to go. Don't give C Ur time.....  Do wat u love
But the language gives u the basics and the foundation
What I love is totally different
Ohhh then do wat u love, give time to wat matters
Exactly
But make sure u benefit from, no one will recognize Ur hustle when Ur not successful
For hackers, Linux is the big boss.
The languages should be Assembly and Python
Yaa Ur right....
That's obvious

_*POWER OF MEETING TOGETHER_
Hebrews 10
Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [as believers], as is the habit of some people, but admonishing (warning, urging, and encouraging) one another, and all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching.
Context:
My brethren as read from scripture.
Don't give up with the habit  of meeting together sometime it may not about praying but just hearing the word or testimony or praise or worship where by you may overcome what you passing through.
Brethren stop praising your challenges in life there are those people who have passed through the same challenges like yours but never gave up but through continuous meeting together they're able too overcome whereby they were hearing testimonies and preachings. Amen
Amen Evangelist 🙏

Now what if it was a big team.since Lyon made you suffer this way
Just go to sleep hate watcher😜your night has really been ruined
Can a team reach quarter finals when it's small ..be serious 😀
If the league is fake u can also take the trophy..en u a playing small teams <This message was edited>
Infact night mere
No me I want you guys to take this trophy so that you can also play in the champions League.with a new set up the  way Liverpool and mancity and Madrid tested on it <This message was edited>
null
😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂so arsenal was also a small team bro
Smallest moreover we had red card ♦️
Today you had no card but you played poor football
The goal was to win
Here in Europa you can win but for premier and champions league you can't win with this style of play
Of course you can't be good in all
😂😂
But it's better if you become good in top leagues of the world
Same too you
Becoming good by name only? I would rather choose to be good by name and actions than being good by name and I end with nothing
The position can tell someone's actions
Guy? every man has a way he does his things so.......🤷
I wish you also make it to champions League next season..coz there is fun that side...if you're not steady a team can give you home and away....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can confirm that
Goodnight bro
Asante bro nawe urare neza

Selena hotel
That's not a place good for chilling
Dear friends,
As we observe Good Friday, let's reflect on Jesus' ultimate sacrifice, symbolizing love, forgiveness, and redemption. His courage in the face of adversity inspires us to stand firm in our values.
On Easter Sunday, we celebrate Jesus' resurrection, representing hope, renewal, and new beginnings. This miraculous event reminds us that challenges can lead to triumph and that faith can overcome darkness.
Let's draw lessons from these events:
1. Forgiveness and compassion
2. Resilience and perseverance
3. Hope and renewal
May these sacred days bring you peace, joy, and spiritual growth.
Thex for the word
Apostle thanks for that
Always 🙏
It's my pleasure, though I'm not worthy of that title
null
No one is always worth those titles but  by God's grace they deserve
Okay
Haha

Hello to everyone
Yes bro
Yoooo,,,any location before Jesus leaves
Jesus said this time he is not leaving
Wait,,he is soon leaving us
Let him go unless wen u want to go to heaven
Jesus has already descended to His Father's place 😢
Sure
En he is now seated on the right hand
Yeah.
He's watching @256782470261 over eating 😁
Not only eating but also drinking
Instead of fasting

Fasting was concluded
But fasting is not starving
Mpozi 2day waz Christians Idd
How do we call the dap 4 christians
> ⓘ _Admin Removed Judas Iscariot_
That one who even died b4 good friday
But these Christians don't prepare pilawo at church,ofila kukigambo,they feed the soul which will go to heaven mbu the body will remain on earth
Kati ffe basilamu story kii
Wait Iddi is coming soon
U feed the body
Why do u go to church yet u are a Muslim ??
They don't prepare because you over eat 🤣
Do we pray 2gether
But minus feeding the body how can the spirit and soul survive
U will know y the word hello wen u remove letter O it becomes hell
But Moslems eat more than xtians
Kati y iz this here
I knew it in Primary 3
Only one Muslim can eat 2 kg of pilawo
They even celebrate Christmas ,
Compensation
I tell u, but do I know how pigs suffered 2de in hands ov xtians bikoz ov pork
Y not
Meaning xtians combine rice en pork olemwa
But on iddi,,pork got finished during day time ,,,what does that indicate ??
Kati for Moslems all their big festive days are called IDD, lwaki like dis
Ne kalo
Moslems also at some point smuggle pork
Nae gwe abasilamu bagende kunyiga fe tuseke
Am talking what l observed on iddi please
Carrot
Those wea xtians pretending to be Moslems as they wanted free rice
Wat happened in the bars if u were attentive
Guyz squeezed in kanzuz
It's called pork trafficking
I was in kololo at H2O but even the prices for beer were increased
However still the demand was too high
U were not observative
Kati 2de even the beer factory ran out ov stock
null
If Jesus turned water into wine,,then who am l not to take his wine
Meaning that u were supposed to take wine
But wine has no problem
The wine ov this generation iz something else, the one for Jesus waz approved from above pliz, the ones ov nowadays are evil
But u need to reduce the quantity
Wine does not lead u to conc highness
Our wine is also approved by unbs
En concentration by adding water
Good night, enjoy the jazz
Not by Jesus anko,UNBS never existed in Jesus tym
Nanti generation differs
Okay webaake omukazi mubike kubanga ensiri ,zijja mulya
The wine of Jesus en this one of current tyms which one is more concentrated
The one for Jesus
Nae gwe papa
What of  the fish and bread.
Which one is sweater, the one Jesus multiplied to feed the 5000 men or the current ones 🙈

Appointed by the cardinals who are the advisors of the pope
Okay 😁
Am seeing your not believing in my answer 😂😂🤗
When the Pope dies, he must be buried after 4, 6 or 9 days .
And all the Arch Bishops from every country must be present. Then after his burial, the bishops must sit within 15 but not beyond 20 days to appoint another Pope from themselves , following some procedures. <This message was edited>
I am but I thought it could be detailed
I wanted to just be brief
Interesting... and some procedures of the initiation after appointing oba they are not there
No problem
Hahahah
I'm not sure of the procedures.
But what I know is that from among the 250+ Bishops, who are cardinals is where the Pope is selected.
Okay thanks
Yaaaa.....your right..not far from what I know too

How????
*WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POPE DIES?*
When the Pope dies, a detailed process called "sede vacante" (vacant seat) begins. Here's what happens:
1. Official death  verification - The Camerlengo (Chamberlain Cardinal) formally verifies the Pope's death by calling his baptismal name three times and tapping his forehead with a silver hammer.
2. The Camerlengo announces the death to the world and destroys the Pope's Ring of the Fisherman and lead seal to prevent document forgery.
3. The Pope's body is prepared for public viewing, typically lying in state at St. Peter's Basilica for several days.
4. A nine-day mourning period called "novendiales" begins, with funeral masses held daily.
5. The Pope is buried, usually in the crypt beneath St. Peter's Basilica.
6. The College of Cardinals meets in a closed-door conclave to elect a new Pope. Cardinals under 80 years old enter the Sistine Chapel, completely isolated from the outside world.
7. Cardinals vote four times daily until someone receives a two-thirds majority. After each unsuccessful round, the ballots are burned with chemicals producing black smoke. When a Pope is elected, white smoke signals the decision.
8. The new Pope chooses his papal name, and the senior cardinal deacon announces "Habemus Papam" ("We have a Pope") from the balcony of St. Peter's.
9. The new Pope appears on the balcony to give his first blessing "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world).
The entire process combines ancient traditions with modern practical considerations to ensure a smooth transition of papal authority.
*ELECTIONOF THE POPE*
The election of a new Pope typically occurs 15-20 days after the death of the previous Pope. Here's how the timeline works:
The College of Cardinals must begin the conclave (the papal election process) no earlier than 15 days and no later than 20 days after the Pope's death. This waiting period serves several purposes:
1. It allows cardinals from around the world sufficient time to travel to Rome
2. It provides time for the proper funeral and mourning ceremonies for the deceased Pope
3. It gives cardinals time for prayer and reflection before making their decision
During the conclave itself, the voting process continues until a candidate receives a two-thirds majority. This could take anywhere from a single day to several weeks, depending on how quickly the cardinals reach consensus.
For example, the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI took just two days, while some historical conclaves have lasted months. However, modern conclaves tend to be relatively brief, usually concluding within 2-5 days.
Once elected, the new Pope assumes office immediately after accepting .

I like how yo trying to be too political
Really 😂😂✌🏻

WEEKEND JUICE
Praise God brethren, how are you .
Let's drink from this bottle:
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
-- Ecclesiastes 12:1
KJV Holy Bible
Brethren use your strength wisely to serve the Lord while you're still a youth before evil time comes your way.
Serving God isn't about age not that people who have grown up who need to serve the Lord. Let's look at the government of uganda which people does it need people to join army sothat is always liken to  God's kingdom.
Thank father for today as we enter into weekend 🙏
You deserve the glory and honour. Amen
May the Peace of God be with us all as we hustle to achieve our dreams.  One love to the DCS family.
Love you all ✌️
Thanks bro 🙏
Glory back to the Almighty God 🙏
Let the president of the clicking association reply under this message
You were clicked last week and even your secretary missed 😂  Mr President where are you driving this thing
U will not understand the rules and regulations of the association. ..most reasons u can't qualify to be in the team
Can I bring evidence
For your own qualification,the committee has to discuss for a month on matters concerning you
😂😂
Btw if u continue with your fake gossip ,your candidate will definitely fail...
Mark my words
Ahh, no there nothing like that.  You can't decide fate
And if you continue like that the click may never come from neither sides😂😂😂
Let us start from your  so called GRC, we will see
Do u need the click or not, first work in the association cabinet matters first before you take in the boys
Have shared values and ambitions, your boys are hooping from one aspirant to another for clicks, individually.  Imagine 😂.
Who will trust that, first organize yourselves,  have meetings,  invite aspirants to your meetings and be straight forward on the click,  not beating around the bush. Coz in the end the aspirant invites u for refreshments,  and after enjoying them you claim you don't need refreshments, that you needed an envelope.  Yet he found you loitering around campus.  I advise you first organize your association or boys and have core values,  ambitions and plans😂😂. Invite aspirants to your organized venues and let them plan accordingly.
Otherwise if you continue hooping like that,  we shall not take you serious 😂😂
We all know where your issues are coming from,At some point. .. we haven't seen any point in this grammar
😂😂😂😂
I see, you can't see a point.  Continuing hooping
Leave the high school campaign u have participated, let me believe but at that also just know you are killing your candidate slowly
How by telling you to organize the boys?, 😂😂.
Are they upset with it
No comments, that's  it
No comments, that's  it👆
Ok do your thing .😂
We shall see
If they themselves create another association out of yours don't say I didn't tell you 😂😂 <This message was edited>
No comments
Lagos and Rajab, you were brothers don't fight for this small issues. We have to be one instead of going for cold war because of our different preferences.
Who's fighting

Some of u , spend most of Ur time reading , mulibagezi
Muganda wange reading this semester is hard,
work, weaknesses, enjoyment
Mwn people read ehhh nze I know them ate bagezi jk , they aren't just showing seriousness
Then it's good.
But for us we believe in group discussions
Group discussions waaaa😂😂 tewali kidako. Abana they read as one man army
Nze ebya one man army byagana this semester.
I only use one man army tactics with personal things , which are even not part of this semester' outline
Haha nkufuna survival for the fittest
Yeah
Oba just watya
Kutya ki
Sem
Mwana semester doesn't favor me.
Next time I'm shifting to weekend
Ate how sebo u have to be concurrent
No.
I won't eat books. 🤣
Life after class is the hardest
But things are easy .
Haha man I feel u 😂😂😂😂 , the condition, u have to survive, the Bible says a man can survive also on the word of God
Bro, to me things are tough.
Maybe they're easy to guys who aren't independent
The Bible clearly teaches "from your sweat you shall get what to eat "
Believe we are the castodians of ourselves.
Yaaa I see but it's better to be independent than being a dependant on the side of boys
And it says blessed are those who believe without seeing. Just believe Ur satisfied no hunger will strike you.
Amen Amen😂😂
Kati oseka ki mazima
Thy shall believe and thy shall not be hungry☺️
Man I mean it , u also can try it out .....
Bro I'm good believer, but the Bible says that let earthly things teach us about the kingdom of God
What did king Solomon ask for from God, wisdom , he believed
He was given the wisdom that tells him
1. hunger is solved by food
2. Poverty is solved by working (I will bless the works of your hands )
So the Bible never advocates for laziness
But the Bible says that those who ask shall be given , from God .
Give wat belongs to ceaser.............
And the Bible says in 2 Thess 3:10
"If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat "
But it also says " Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not SEEN. Faith is the evidence of things not SEEN. U may not see food for the whole day but faith is seen
And when you continue in the book of Hebrews, it clearly teaches that Faith without works is dead. Faith should not be passive, but rather accompanied by actions.
That's why for a student to pass , they must read.
If one prays and doesn't read, it means they're tempting God and they won't pass. <This message was edited>
Isiah 41:10  I will strengthen you and help you. Do not fear, so am with you. Wat does it mean even if Ur hungry u have spent 1 week with out food, he is with you
U can pray and don't read then u pass excellently , blessed are those who believe without seeing. Once again
Bro that's wrong.
When there's something you can do to solve a problem and you deliberately refuse, in the name of having faith, then it's tempting God.
That's why God made the Israelites move and suffer in the wilderness, he would have just carried them to the land He promised.
That event clearly describes faith in God as actionable and not passive
Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the plans I have for you , declares the Lord.
Plans to bring you a  future and not disaster
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial, hunger is trial 😂😂 my colleagues , having stood the test that person will receive the crown of life
And the Bible still teaches that "my people perish for lack of understanding"
The problem with fellow Africans, they like spiritualization of everything.
For example when a child suffers from measles, they don't take it to the hospital and just pray. God has power to heal, but then the standards at which  God operates are beyond human understanding. That's why he gave us authority to have dominion over nature, to be co-creators and problem solvers
Hold on!!... Are you talking about just hunger oba fasting and prayer? <This message was edited>
Otyoo😅
Trust in the Lord with all Ur heart and lean not on your own understanding 😂
Haha 😂😂😂 real hunger u face
Dey play😑😂
The Lord is good and refuge in the times of trouble (hunger). He cares for those who trust in him.
God Himself gave us the land to cultivate and eat its fruit.
It's true He cares for us.
But he cares for those in real trouble, not those who leave His principles and expect His help
The Bible describes land as flowing with milk and honey. Not cultivating
Fruit is described as patience , faithfulness
Quote that verse and share with us
Exodus 3:8
Don't confuse the fruits of the Holy Spirit with fruits of land
Better interprete that verse well.
There was no mandate from God about your submission
Man onsesa😂😂
If those are the fruits, then why would God demand tithe and offering.
Do you see how off track your doctrine is
Give generously and cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:6-7) it doesn't explicitly say we give tithe
That's to humans, but in the books of Malachi and Deuteronomy God clearly talks about tithes, offerings
Believers are encouraged to give out by their means, rather than giving out of obligation
Of course.
There's no offertory that is constant, rather according to one's means. And thats what the Bible teaches, to give at will but without forgetting the tithe <This message was edited>

Now l see you getting my point bwaaahhahahah clearly 😊😊
Oyo magezi mugezi daalaa
Mbu UICT politics is in the state ov political fiasco mogi mogi, madern deficit and we are in a state of lugumbulus🤣🤣
It came to be the way it is because every one have been given the audacity to participate in it
But the ones meant to be will always serve their people with passion, not on desperation, gullibility and hunger(thirst)
ehhhh and if we don't fight it, we shall see the rim ram, halam skalam, political gambadoism
Surely.
It's so absurd
But keep strong, my good people of DCS, we walked far, we are almost their... for this reason, I can't let my people get lost amidst the way... I will walk with you till we reach the promised land.
Have a good night gallants of DCS🙏

WEDNESDAY WEEKLY DEVOTION
Praise God Brethren 💞
Scripture :
ROMANS 8:1>>> KJV Holy Bible
❤️‍🩹There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.❤️‍🩹
CONTEXTS 💌
The bible says that any one who is in christ Jesus is not condemned so brethren I  call upon you let's embrace christ Jesus as our lord and saviour to avoid condemnation.
PRAYER
Thank you Father for today many your lovely children embrace Jesus christ as their lord and saviour to avoid condemnation
Amen
I think we all know Mr @256782470261 is the favorite to  represent us 🤷‍♂️
Ask electrol commission
I need for GRC but all the two people are friends what should I do🤣😂😜🤓
The way see the picture I think one of is the one who has posted it 😂🤣
I rather leave but when I have campaigned for @⁨Yonah Uict⁩ because I have already seen him from the beginning but you🤣😂 Aaaaaah 👎how can you convince me really sorry for  you😭😭
No offense bro.... everyone is entitled to their choices 🙌🙌let's be calm
That's true 🤞
True dat 👊
We should support with wisdom.... not trash anyone
No need to vex,let everyone support his or her own side without grudges ,
what matters is on how each aspirant is able to convince students for votes
But mostly,
"The Clicking Aspect is key".🔥🔥
Today we have prayer
Venue: prayer ground
Everything is good but we need God in Everything we do
Hope and change, together we can🤝
Competition is stiff now,🤔🤔
The Clicking Association will decide
as usual
we dont want sweet toking jst click u a nt pastors
dats da motto in clinking we click
I have just been waiting for proposal only 😎💝👍
Devine son👍...
The change we need the change we deserve 👍👍
And promise to Click also🤣🤣
Assured
When God told him to go and lead the people of Nineveh the Capital of Assyria, Yonah first hesitated because whoever is called Yonah doesn’t just make a decision. He was swallowed by fish 🐠 and spend days of darkness in the stomach of fish😂. Then he accepted! I am convinced that @256782470261 has had his own experience he went through before he finally accepted to lead us. Thanks for the Bold decision I know it’s after immense retrospection. Wish you brighter days of fulfilling God’s will and leading us to that destiny we desire. <This message was edited>
Preach brother 😂
💪😂 Alleluia
😮😮😮the word of God🙏🙏
Said by angel @256783289958 😹😅😹

So
Just try hard to click and everything wil move smoothly on your side📢🙏 <This message was edited>

But where have you been..
You missed our GRC live on ntv and aljazera during the day
Bro it's a long story
I really missed a lot
I was in a serious fight at campus and now having serious wounds 🥹
who did u wrestle with earlier
C
But I had a big victory
The language or a human
Congz to u
A human .
Charles .
Thanks
U would have said it in full not C, C just is a language
The problem I forget a lot.
I wanted to mean C the language 🤦
Seems u wea handling C and Java at the same time, that's maybe the cause ov this small Amnesia yo going through
I handled  C and Assembly language at the same time .
Now I'm going for a brain scan tomorrow 🥹
Okie
Just  watch the barca game to calm down the brain
🧏🧏🧏
I'm first cooking 🤣🤣
This single life 🤦
Good morning Sir
Y waste too much time on that, get a kikos in a kavera and suck while watching
Man 🤣🤣🤣
I'm tired of sucking 🤣
Alloo bro, a u mistaken or u have some challenge, its good evng pliz not mrng
Man I last saw you tomorrow! Where have been?
Then fork the partially minced chapati and half fried beans on a plate of u tired ov sucking
Sorry .
Good evening 🤦
@256767475239 last seen tomorrow at 2:00
I have been in yesterday man 🤣
Bro, u need some rest, the yo situation is climbing to other stages
Mutandise mbogo
Let me cook in peace 🤣🤣
I understand, u are an Arsenal boy
🤣🤣
Last seen on labour day 2025
Why 😅😅😅
Someone to remind me whether onana is still in Man U?
As early as arsenal 😹😹😹😹
Let those who don't know football sleep plz 😹😹😹
I tell u, moreover by also a black like Dembele big up to Thuram
Tell them
But he is also from France 😂
Call Amorim right now and find out, here we don't manage that boy
Though black, I didn't mention a country, I said black, this is colour
He deserves
But you want violence yet you are still young for it
Ok
U know, am not a bro to argue with, so bring anada topic not this
Actually, I have heard that Arsenal wants to sell Saka. Have you heard the same colleagues
From which sources did u get this, from Arteta or Mucele?
Yes. .
Man U wants to buy Saka 🧍
But why can't u sleep 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Leave our analyst 🤣🤣
World sports
Live bro to analyze foota, if he understands it, let him prove his talent, don't stop him, instead u are the one to sleep
U see! True
Yeah. .
Even Chelsea wants Maguire
Men know football 😹😹😹the rest of the ladies can sleep
I wanted to say this also
0:2
This game will be sweet....let's now wait for a comeback
I think Arteta wants to lay strategies how to take champions league
Man there iz no analysis done about yo research, its unauthentic and look like scam, its only Real Madrid that has eyed him wanting to drop over 130m€ for him
Are you watching I come there
Next time you will loose
Just hurry...in our usual place
Ok bro.
Let me first mingle posho <This message was edited>
I feel there iz no comeback, inter iz something else bro, it really fucks pipol
But yamal is another danger ⚡ 1:2
And the real point iz he cant
This is a draw.
2:2
Twende, the game becomes cool at this point
Yayaha
What are u saying let mr@256783289958 explain to u who is yamal
No it will be like those things of Benfica Benfica and Real Madrid Real Madrid 😅😅😅😅😅🙌
Kale, let me not tok much, am now seeing, tugende maso, this iz what real big men play like, not kacele games like Arsenal
Bro, am eyeing more goals, if its a draw, it might be beyond 2:2, koz the game gas oz so far good
Goals are coming
JK, the boyz are doing very wonderful, they are in a state ov goal Fiasco Mogi Mogi🤣🤣
Continue
2:2
Remontada
That's what we want
Goals are doing very wonderfully
Mpozi who said dat Inter will beat Barcelona 😂😂
🤣🤣
Let me withdraw now .
Money has come 😂😂
Now we are back to 0:0
Rwwww, the goal economy iz doing wonderfully, ehhh
Gwe nawe vayo with yo two eggs
Let me keep quiet just
If first half iz like this, just imagine the 2nd half
Arsenal should pray that PSG bounces them off, otherwise, they can't manage this type ov terror game
They will just be skinned with 5 goals in the 30 mins🤣🤣
That's good ov u
We need a new topic! Not football. Because you are making us to keep quiet.
Anko
U understand wat Barca means wen it's 2-2
My birthday is soon🤫
Ok
Okay @256767475239 let’s talk about basketball. And Lebron James is the topic
A man like u not to be knowing football 😂😂
Just join the ladies in lugambo session, koz if its another topic, am sure its lugambo and wolokoso, here we the Broz, we ain't in that shit
I tell u, slaughter iz coming in 2nd half
My favorite is a different one
Tetwagala daza
A leader must be able to feel for others. Much as I know football, but I realized that @256767475239, @256763828569 etc kept quiet. What doesn’t imply? I have to advocate their freedom of speech 🎤
But u speaking some other topic has failed to resurrect them on board
So, we move with wat the majority prefer
I can't wait bro.
In June
That's it exactly
Ahhh 😯 bro, all that far! My rice can’t wait 😜
The whole Arsenal crew shall come eat the Rice
Man be mature in brain not every nosense that you put in the platform there are big responsible in this platform respect yourself????????? 😂
Colleagues the issue isn't code every one can write code, but how are u using it to solve a problem just ka remanider 📌
I tell u
We shall talk about that after the 90 mins
Please keep it. June is near
Ehhh bro, that's harsh, u must understand that the person yo replying iz a sis not a bro
May God bless you!
🙏
Exactly. With an Arsenal design cake 😀
If you are not the one being referred to, then you should also learn how to mind your own business because its a full time job
Hahaha with “visit Rwanda on it”
Problem Arteta gat no head shape like Liverpool bozz or city boss, otherwise the cake could be in that shape🤣🤣
Colleagues, theres another match! Let’s let’s bet which team will win 🥇
😭😭 chai
Yeah 🤣
After googling sir 😹🤣
Haaa, oba how should we compare it to, Ars vs PSG, or Barca vs inter
Which google? These are our things. Michael Jordan is my role model
Tulete kwepiina?
Exactly.
1MOLE THE BYTE BANTER +1
It will be in Ancelotti head 🤣🤣
And yet u can't even jump or bang a 3 pointer
Ehhh those are our jokes
mmm, ok
Those things were supposed to be inboxes so that we can't see , the bible says who soever shall know the truth shall set him free John 8:32
You dont have to react on everything, react on what concerns you, you aint Jesus Christ to act like a saviour, get a life
But it waz tagged in someone's name, pliz my bro, OK, chill that topic otherwise it might lead to a slight war, imagine with a sis, that's not good bro, keep the vigour low, let's discuss other matters like football than quarrelling
Tyra, calm down, 4get the shit and we move pliz, its now a bye gone, let by gones be bygones, that shit character ain't cool, stop it <This message was edited>
Some people should first learn how to mind their own businesses
Ayabass, We are back in live for the 2nd phase ov the game <This message was edited>
Its OK, he has heard
Man am not quarrelling but am trying to correct you guys on how to select some things to write in the platform like this one
OK, people have heard and we are off that topic, let's move on
Tell him to first remove the log in his eyes before trying to remove the stain  in other people's eyes
Lets continue wz barca match
Good girl, I respect u now, thanks 4 understanding
Izzy, seems he has seen
🚨 As things stand, the following players are injured and could miss the 2nd leg vs. Inter and El Clásico:
- Marc Casadó
- Balde
- Lewandowski
- Jules Koundé
Chill after role every thing is being solved
Cool
peace maker nicho,
And am trying to imagine in case they were present on line up
Haha, we need Peace not war

Issues of over yapping, i don't like 🤣🤣

That's the rule

🗣️ This semester, we mobilize with purpose, rise with pride, and lead with vision.
Be part of a generation that doesn’t just witness change — we shape it.
This is not all about group A or B
We are all DCS and we need a leader for us all .
And I can assure you the only person who can and has done even for both of us is the inclusive guy..
If someone is already in a leadership role (class coordinator), they should also support others to lead it shows real leadership.
No comments, we are just watching not until the needful is done
Leadership is meant to uplift, not monopolize. True leadership identifies potential, creates pathways, and supports progress. My experience as coordinator has taught me precisely how to empower others while maintaining organizational integrity.
No worries 👍 ☺
What i mean is if a person already holds a leadership position like being the class coordinator, they don’t always need to take every other leadership role too. Instead, true leadership is shown when they help and encourage others to step up and lead as well,giving them a chance . It’s about creating opportunities for others, not holding all the power.
Was just saying😌.
Anyway lets leave that😊
Thanks for understanding 🙏 😊😊
Thanks a lot
Yonah oyeeee our incoming GRC DCS they are even delaying for us to elect you as our GRC 💌

Devine son...🤝🤝🤝
I respect that, and I agree leadership should uplift and empower. That’s exactly why I believe others should also be given a chance to lead it’s part of growing together as a team.😊😊😁😁
Not understood 😄😄.
I will try though😊
Leadership is not given chance...
Leadership is seen from ones capability..
Why should we give chance to test others yet we have already seen a capable leader before ..I submit 🙏
I hear you, and I respect that capability matters. But even the most capable leaders were once given a chance to prove themselves.  Great leaders also started somewhere. We shouldn’t close the door on others before they even try.
#Every expert was once a beginner.😊😊😁😁
I think that's why we have voting my dia🤗.. never worry it's not far
Experience isn't gatekeeping, it's insurance when stakes are high. At this critical juncture in our DCS program, we need proven navigation. While tomorrow needs new leaders, today demands tested ones. I promise to forge paths for others to follow, creating chances without compromising outcomes. My footsteps will become your roadmap.
True 🤗🤗......
But experience alone shouldn't be the main factor.
Sometimes fresh leadership brings new energy, ideas, and growth. 😊😊😊😊
I have seen a muteso lady with big Nyash here in Bukoto 🤔
A new broom sweeps clean but an old one knows all corners ..I rest my case??
Tested leaders are valuable, but let’s not forget 🧏‍♂️🧏‍♂️  they were once given a chance to be tested. 😊😊
True but every old broom was once new, and it only learned the corners because someone gave it a chance to sweep.😊😊😊
🤗I also rest my case
But what is your final say?..coz up to now we can't trace what your up to😯 ...do u mean others have to step aside to give chance to your person
Not at all 😊 I’m not saying anyone should step aside. I’m simply saying we shouldn’t make experience the only reason to choose. Let’s also consider potential, character, and fresh ideas.
Why should you go for new broom yet an old one is still in use?
Well said comrade, and I am much convinced that all your suggestions weren't being sub-lined before.
It's just an *"Inclusive move💬🍃"*
U gerrit it😜

Those nyashes will kill u one day😂

But I don't know why when your campaigning for your talking in this language....and if we return to your way of talking then u may not like it
Colleagues, I have a security breach question which is against computer act and anti privacy policy. Using someone’s contact info eg. Email, and other handles without owners consent is also a cyber attack, and malice. <This message was edited>
Sorry if ........😌
And who gave them authorisations to send us information on our emails without our consent... You have broken the law <This message was edited>
That's the first thing that came to mind...
Hon.@256782470261 and Hon Katumba could please explain the conspiracy between you to use our sensitive information to make unintended communication. When I knew that my email is safe with Class representative. That is phishing and spamming of the highest level
It's not about apologizing to me .but just know people are always following here and judging your capability and capacity
Which law
I dint apologise,there some unsaid words i left by adding "............"
Lets chill 😌 that
I have not shared my email to anyone to receive political things ....where could you have gotten it plz..come speak to public.meanwhile as you ask for apology for using our emails for spam <This message was edited>
Computer act. U shall not send spam messages neither shall u use peoples privacy data without their consent whether communicating business or social communication unless it’s publicly revealed and all persons are free to access it
Do you know the use of an email
Dear Colleagues,
I wish to clarify that I have not sent any communications to DCS class members' email addresses, despite having access to the complete distribution list. I fully respect email privacy and am aware of the legal regulations outlined in the Computer Act regarding unauthorized electronic communications.
If you have received any inappropriate messages appearing to be from me or anyone else for unknown reasons, please know they were not authorized. I apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused.
Have a pleasant weekend.
Best regards,
*Yonah Odongkara*
GRC Candidate
Let the one  who sent these messages on our emails come and clarify to the public please??
Explanation well received. Whoever is concerned should clarify how you accessed my email without my consent.
True, privacy matters and no one should misuse personal data. But in this case, it doesn’t seem like spam, it looks like official communication meant to support us as students.  The emails came from school platforms, so don’t overgrow the issue.
But it’s noted, they won’t use them again without clarity.
WIC law have we broken bro
Well said! Thank you for being humble!
Thanks for understanding..🙏
I appreciate 🙏as well .
It’s all about understanding each other .
If you read the email sent to your inbox
The messages are totally clear to the point so let's not call it a spam message cause u can verify the sender
Inboxing someone via Gmail isn't a crime anywhere in the computer act laws so let's have a jazz via ✉️
Hope that is clear
Otherwise we wished to hear from owner of the clip but since you have spoken for him....let's chill 🙂
Its a pleasure 🙏
Its noted
So your still insisting to be more than Eliens ..ok continue 🫷
I want the members to get this point clear
Don’t take us back to Egypt. This kind of brute force
😂😂
Hes just clarifying thats all.
Lets chill that topic
True. The fact that  our emails were shared in a document of discussion groups doesn't mean that we should be spammed without our consent. I think the right way would be by creating a google form, survey monkey or related stuff so as members consent the use of their emails .

*Happy Weekend, Champions!*
Leadership isn’t framed by paper—it’s proven by purpose. While diplomas gather dust, *inclusive representation* builds futures. This weekend, reflect: Do we want *inspiration* or *transformation*? Strength isn’t in titles—it’s in tireless action for *all*. Rest well; Monday demands our courage. 🌟

If papers are truly useless, then what’s the reason for you still studying? Clearly, they hold some value we just need to know how to use them wisely.
Ur ryt 100%. Just know how to use them. On those papers add on the skills trust me , u will out compete those with degrees mine nigar. Me at my Job I work with people of master, phds, degrees but just because of skills
We stand by it because we believe in making our diploma count.Our diploma matters.
It’s surprising to hear that from someone also doing a diploma. Instead of discouraging others, we should be uplifting each other and making the most of what we have.
Politics politics, Broz let's bring this shit down, dont let it pound down yo minds
U deserve to share with me a pot ov malwa, bro, that's all we need
Exactly bro, that’s the spirit.Papers plus skills that’s the winning combo. It’s not about the level, it’s how you use what you have.
I wanted to show you that a certificate guy with a positive mindset is far better than your diploma which you think is important.otherwise the current world we are in carries nothing with paper.. think of bringing us slogans that will change our mindset ..we shall welcome that .
In java we have a term called concurrency things work hand in hand at the same time
Man i hv been viewing this conversations since morning but all the same guys need to make their vibes high,i don't critise any bcos thy use their own data but all the same we are waiting for clicks🤒🔥
Dem click, we move
Clicks are coming
Alooo
I feel like doubting
Now u get the point I was talking about....thanks for understanding..then change your slogan.😹our diploma doesn't matter what matters is what you have as content
Towakana tomorrow am coming to campus, so be there, am bringing logistics
Totusesa
We know u can never make it on weekendz
U have not got me well nigar, skill moves along with papers . Do u think I work with those guys with out papers . Belamu
Man believe me enkya logistics are coming so it's up to u to appear man
am the one receiving the goods in transit
Our slogan isn’t about bragging, it’s about reminding ourselves that what we’ve worked for still has value.
However  yeah with content and the right mindset 😊we are unstoppable. The slogan is just a reminder of the value we are building.
Lets chill this 🤝😊
Guys do u know cybogz in oba terminators

Bro, crazy shit happens, just be u, I waz in the same condition not too long
Surely.
But it was family love.
I really miss her. 🥲
My cousin 🥲

1 Samuel 16:7ffff
But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.
MEDIATION
Don't judge by appearances. God looks beyond the surface and sees our hearts. He sees us through Jesus' grace and offers us a place in our hearts. Don't pass up an opportunity until you've seen what's inside. You never know what God has in store.
PRAYER
Lord, open the doors of my heart and make it a holy place for You. May it be a place of worship and reverence. Amen.
Amen brother.

It's happening now! Join ASAP
Greetings everyone
The DCS community
Our official GRC group
Guys let's join in
Wacha
Colleagues, we want government sponsored students here 🌝. They have to tell us something
They are saying that the economy is not yet doing wonderful
This silence could be sponsored by them, don't accept those lies bro
They should give us some money , money has come....
I like uou, u always say the truth
they are quiet
I saw one entering kingdom kampala 30 mins ago 😊😊
Hahaha people gat money
Guys if I post my business here,  will guys support me or the economy is messing with you 😂
Post as we collect money to come support a bro 👊
Lets first see the business 😂
Don't post , this is not a watsapp business group
MONDAY JESUS AT HOME DEVOTION
Praise God brethren how are you,  I know you are preparing for tests but this for you
Contexts
1 corinthians 9:23
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.
MEDIATATION
Jesus wants us to use our gifts to bless others. I saw this firsthand when a friend cried out for help when she was sick and had no one to help her when she was weak to do anything. She asked me to buy tablets and carried her back to bed and prayed for her then I left when she was was well. She said she felt Jesus' love and care without thepresence of her friends. We can use our gifts to serve others, not for our own gain, but for the gospel."
PRAYER
Dear Jesus, we are so grateful for the chances to serve You and to demonstrate Your love to others. We thank You for these blessings. Amen.
Thank you pastor, we acknowledge this
This is so wonderful
Thex for the word bro
Pastor I have an ask, can you just pray for me  and I pass.
It's urgent
👍🏻👍🏻
Yeeeeeeee............our man💪
Nga am not seeing my self being recognized
Did you go through vetting?
Coz only the ones in that letter made it through
am wondering why on this list appears no first years????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
They lack expertise and experience
for sure something is wrong
Ohhh is that soo.... whoever chose them better come and explain otherwise 🤨
It's first years supposed to take up those positions
where are people responsible for this crap
a chance has been denied with purpose
The guild parliament interviewed them...so the guild president and his team are to answer for this
But isn't it alarming that no DCS student is among the electoral committee
Haha mwagala tekawo ka vuyo
I have a suggestion 😌
Ateh...
Tell us
Truly alarming
The process was rigged 😒, we need to do something
Like for sure
The Speaker had earlier raised a concern on the vetting.... it wasn't supposed to take place today
But the GP insisted and did the process with his few henchman ignoring the right procedures
Guys, if at all there is no one in DCS who applied for any vacancy, it's understandable.
But if there are, it doesn't sound good to have no member on the committee from DCS
@256768711875 applied for treasurer
Ehhh
Four of our People applied
@256754752322 applied for procurement officer
Not now 🤣🤣

Naye banange atuberede ko ki, atuleke tusome for frayo
It's true and urgent
Let's hurry up and get their
Get to know about it
And get to campus as soon as u can
When did he say so
Leave the when and be at campus before 11
So why didn't you communicate earlier...or you just got the information also
We just received the information 15 mins ago
are these guys serious??!!!!!
you just can't put test fwaaaa!!
Man!
Like yoooo...😭😭😭😭😭
We are far, wats this now, he would have informed us earlier like yesterday, how can u inform pipol in just 15 mins, wats that
Whats the penalty of nt doing the test?
So I should board a taxi from mukono now😂
Is the test on everything we have studied so far
Nigga is the god now, better submit😂
There's a lecture at 11 in the seminar room for both A and B. Computer hardware and maintenance
Not a test?
Lecture or test
No
This isn't allowed btw
He should have told us yesterday.
Can't he see the rain and people are coming from far.
Yes
Now this thing has gone beyond limits hw can someone just put a test out of the blue
pardon?????
Whoever got that information from the lecturer should see away of advising that guy accordingly, coz u might have just also accepted fwaa,,
I hope so
It's not a test
But who is responsible there is a group for admin why can't he communicate..
Chemonges came in the room. The class rep is not around
Alright but even if I thought wen we a going for exams they don't teach
Now wat of the test??🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
And then wat happened
He first randomly puts his programs and he thinks we shall also tolerate his insults in class too...naye adulthood is hard
Surely, I rarely check this side 😂,
😂😂😂😂
@m with u bro
They should communicate in the official group... otherwise
Aspiring GRC's show some efforts
This sem😭😭
Owiny where are you
We need a clear clarification about this @256782470261 @256777962860
its true, at 11:00  H/W
Gift, y are u lafing instead😂?
Wat is true
Eeeeeeeee tell the guy we a at hm reading n we a not ready for the test we a not in High school were they give spot tests
The Grc who will prove their worth today is the one i will vote for 👀
Which someone is that
Ok sorry fi dat
Me too.
Everything aside water is too cold
Isn't he the same person who said he won't disturb students until we get done with tests
Wat a test obba lecture
Ikr
?????
Its raining heavily, so we a not coming, he should know this
Eeeh, this is serious
Am in katogo area and it has started flooding🤣🤣
Right now ts too cold😂,
Buh that aside leaving da bed z anaza war😂
@256782470261 how did you get the info and @256754752322 who informed you...I will only believe if he actually told someone
You either choose to believe or not....
I can't believe blindly
That's how it's a prank coz he said he won't teach till after tests
First of all I see ,,you're at school... you are actually the best person to prove to us
we are all meeting for the lecture not the test ,for group B he came and students were not in class so he decided we all meet at 11.Both  A and B. at S.ROOM
The lecturer came in the room, we were 4 and that's what he told us
As the opposition side I approve no test since there a no communications in the main group so let's enjoy our beds
The paper is confirmed at 11am in the seminar room.
This one is at campus but the she is fighting for those at home 😅
Naye
That doesn't mean anything.
Being at school doesn't mean I'm always in class...I've been in my room reading since it's raining outside
Okay thank you
Those ones at campus will attend
He lowkey wants to collect his allowance
He told us it's a lecture
You neither choose to be a class rep or GRC ..OR not to inform us
U🤐😂😂
36 minutes to go😊
Forward this to the lecturer😂 tell him happiness is free😂😂😂
if the 4 alrdy students of B who are thea, n those 10 students coming from B right now from home, then the A few students n those from hostel join, t will b a class good for lecture😂
This is the clear info
JUST TRY AND COME GUYS, YOU NEVER KNOW!
I wish chemonges iz joined here to explain himself then after he exits the group
He doesn't have a whatsapp account
I would have done that
That's why you have never seen him texting in groups
He lacks data kiki
Gwe, watch out, he has a dota here, she will report u
Vayoo nawe, attend alone
How can combine two groups in Seminar room
Let him be serious.......
Am going
we have not refused
Who is she ad she just inform us about the numbers coming in de test 🤗
What if we all boycot the test?💀
Ok
I feel like......
I swear @256782470261 and @256777962860  add him in we talk to him direct
Chemonges can never even give the dota bullets for a paper
Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣 uganda zabbu
Forsure coz this man🥹
He should be serious...He is the one that told us that he's coming back after tests,now a lecture for wat?
He perhaps thinks that we drive
Atee mbu taliku watsap
Guys united we stand, divided we fall so no doing Mr chemonges' test and leave the rest to me
Actually @256777962860 and @256782470261 you are the ones supposed to tell that man our suggestions,,,,,,,, you inform him that we are not around
You're talking cos this side it's even raining

FRIDAY DEVOTION
Good morning, colleagues. How are you
SCRIPTURE
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
-- 2 Chronicles 7:14
KJV Holy Bible
MEDIATATION
God calls us to humble ourselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from our wicked ways. He is ready to forgive and heal our land, but we must be passionate in our prayers. We must seek Him persistently, with compassion, crying out for His mercy and power to fall on us. Let us commit to praying more intensely for the lost and for revival, until our land is healed.
PRAYER
Heavenly Father, we come to You asking for forgiveness for our sins and the sins of Your people. We humbly ask that You help us turn away from our wicked ways and bring healing to our land. We pray for a revival of Your Spirit in our lives. In Jesus' name, Amen.

It's so guiding ♥️
In an academic journey like ours, we need more of such informations to either boost us or awaken our intuitions.

Lack of prior knowledge and a road map is suicidal
You're very correct brother.

Dear Students, well done with the centralized tests. This is to remind you about a communication i made to you when we met on the 5th May 2025. I informed you that there is no break after centrals tests. The lecturers are therefore waiting for you in the various classes. Please note that the attendance of class this week also counts on the minimum 75% that is expected of you in a semester to qualify for final examinations. Thank you. AR

God knows

Wen their collecting the sumaries
But the problem was with communication.
The earlier the better and the later the worse 😁
That's the thing
Those who sleep in hostel around compass should attend
you guys need to pick a leaf or two from mubs
Wat are u trying to say
madam AR said that unless we set ourselves technically apart, the diploma is as good as the PLE certificate🥲
Man I'm misunderstanding u
Fast record
I heard that being said and my no.1 question was whether she's proud of producing incompetent students
Because the institute has many facilities that are passively utilized.
1. No functional labs
2. Non functional AVR
3. Outdated policies
4. Intimidating lecturers
Remember the fish started rotting from the head
Disclaimer: my opinion
I have painfully seen and witnessed this, it is where my Agenda lies on... come rain come sunshine, I am ready to be entangled by the Admin in pursuit for these critical solutions
That's my guy
I was also there...🤣🤣🤣
The AR also said stop saying your diploma matters 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
To her because she won't employ us
Exactly bro.
This is the time when our actions should mark the start of a fundamental change at UICT.
TOGETHER WE'RE UNSTOPPABLE.
Let's ko-tow and do this together ❤.... I will boldly take the lead in rightfully advocating the move to reawaken the systems that are sleeping
That's it Mr. GRC
EVERY STEP MATTERS IN SHAPING OUT FUTURE.
Come June, we're marking the start of an era characterized and defined by *ACTION*
#ActionOrientedAgenda

Ok your Auntie 😂
She's so principled

Exactly.
That's why she's the best Auntie.
She needs to start beating some people here KIBOKO.

Ryan is just a neighbor, not a son 🤣🤣🤣🙌
Will this leave our auntie happy.
Eheee her own son to be called a neighbor 🤔😅😅😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ryan knows the truth. He just comes home to eat chicken but he's our neighbor's son.
Friendly neighbor😂.
Yeah.
That's the best description 🤣🤣🙌
Be there.
He will throw stones against u when u also go to there home then
You even took our dish and didn't  return it 🤣 <This message was edited>
But she's still auntie  although am the neighbor 😂
He can't. 🤣
Maybe he's preparing something to return papa with in the dish.🤣🤣
I guess
Yeah.
Maybe .
But Rayan is waiting for Auntie to remind him 🤣
Ok. Just leave him to own it.
Incase he come back the auntie will just be putting there 😅

Good evening Auntie.

Again the friendly neighbor has taken off 😂.
Buh auntie has taken her to do what
Mine was very long.
But finally it's gone
Thank God for that

He's here asking for supper 😀
Yep .
Rayan has been crying mbu Auntie is no where to be seen
Hope he carried the dish 😅
Didn't see him crying thoo
He has it. 😂😂
You reached when he had stopped.
@256700614619 can tell you the whole story
I know the when he saw the sweets in the auntie's bag. He had to stop 😄
Exactly 😂
And after giving him the biscuits, he's now playing with joy 😂
So you were waiting for sweets
Rayan only.
Wat about you
U don't like gifts?
He was asking for Auntie kumbe he's targeting the sweets. Now that you've come , he's quiet, after consuming the sweets and biscuits
I like
Like wat
I like gifts
Like sweets
Biscuits
Daddies
Money
Money 😂🙌🏾
The rest are gifts for girls
Because it can buy the rest of the gifts
But even us the young boys 😁
I'll rather give you money...u want one of those video games
Especially football
But Auntie you're forgetting that your son likes eating more than games 😁
That's not developmental
Meaning I start fasting 🥲
I don't know
Goodnight
But I will balance the equation
Likewise Auntie
this is how you are gona make kids without giving birth😅
u boy grow up😅😅
You've started again 😂😂😂
I'm just 13😂😂😂

Exactly.
We would make sure she goes through unopposed
yeah
but how do u see , AUNTI SHOULD TAKE US FOR LUNCH TOMORROW😅
🤣🤣🤣
Let's wait for her response 🤣
But @256754752322 can take us for lunch tomorrow. She's ready
that one received 2M for miss UICT and never took us😅😅😅
This time she will take us.
@256754752322 say something regarding this matter
I'm not seeing any matter 🧐😂
😂😂
Gwe are u seeing anything?
Yes coz that was a lot of money to take your circle outside
@256767475239 @256778995198 this pic summarises the whole situation
The matter of getting 2M as Miss UICT and you fail to sponsor me and @256779025158 for lunch 😂😂
I've shared my sad story in a picture
Possible questions
1. Wc economic activity is taking place
2. What factors led to the development of the above economic activity
3. What are the challenges associated with the economic activity in (1) above
4. Apart from the economic activity above, wc other activity can be carried out in that place
Photographic interpretation 🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌
auntie will sort us out😅
Naye banage 🤔🤣🤣🤣
But I used to cram Geography. Maybe interpret your story in an understandable manner
Surely.
But my heart is telling me that Ruth will as well sort us out. Let's not give up easily 🤣
@256761445755 happy bd

Nella u will remain with such a mind set
It's just a ka simple lecture
I understand.Olaba leero oyogedde then ............
Just ka 1..2 1...2
Let me tell you one thing.
Some of us understood how life has to move.
1. Fun is part of us
2. We take everything at it's simplicity
3. But deep down we're far beyond what you think
4. We don't like Bragging, that's why we fit in every group at campus
5. We simply experienced the hard fact of life and learned to live it at its simplicity ✌️ <This message was edited>
So u sat down ad created all this 😂😂😂
Ohh am seeing the battle but remember Katumba Douglas says we are family.
the road map for next week is out
My late grand Pa always told me to live my life the way it makes me happy. That's why I'm true to myself.
I do whatever defines me, after all at the end of the moment I will be happy.
My advice to you young man is that you swallow your pride and live life at its simplicity, otherwise you may not understand why  people have different heights .
This is so connotative, think about it.
But in every story I create, I make sure that some one else is the protagonist other than me <This message was edited>
U invite me I nature people...
you are an instructor already😅
I wonder 🤔
💭 like really 😂
Musaja I spend 90% of my time reading.
Be ready on Monday, the movement is on. Our GRC HAS STARTED WORKING BEFORE HE HAS TAKEN THE SEAT🔥
Battle of vegkop and blood river wars , ye do u even remember those battles, I bet money some one to tell me about those battles
That's why am trying to lecture our lost colleagues to switch back to the correct lane
SO?, WONT YOU LEND US 30 - 60 MINS LECTURING OUR PEOPLE
Yes. .
Better think about society in a perceptive manner other than being deceptive
Monday am busy man , may not appear and wat I know colleagues are not cordinative, I recently called them for git , they refused it was their own benefits
Now l see your just tired

Manyi ga kifuba, Road master
Man Phoedex .....
But Road Master was  the best brand .........with durable spokes
U guy get serious
Ehhh u understand them better
my grand father used to use road master
Man same with mine
My grandpa had both. And they're still in his museum
In our o level they could take attendance in bathroom en the  patron was serious lyk the lecturers  during lectures 😃😀😃😀🫡😃🫡😃🫡,if  attendance in bathroom is below 75% suspension but at campus u may e en be given a retake ,so was the patron training us or......
Man at single schools that was impossible.
The patron would receive hot slaps 😂😂😂 <This message was edited>
Wat is ur suggestions then
For us our warden would stand at the entrance ov the dorm to view those that don't bathe and record their names for ABC
😂😂😂😂😂
He asks u, did u shower
Y didnt u say that ur NoNe <This message was edited>
Man it was a different case with us.
we were good at bathing twice a week and female teachers could complain that our classrooms stink 😂😂
but fumes wea always in stock
Yes 😂😂😂
At their highest concentration 😂
And how would the stink come out, maybe only wen one ov the boyz passes concentrated biogas
Man just know single schools are tough . Boys are hard to manage
Tag Ombaci boyz in Arua city those boyz are real wild animals
🤣🤣🤣
Talk about the victim of double single for 6 years 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Not forgetting the mighty Tororo college, Bukedi College Kachonga,
Kabalega SS and Layibi College 🔥
It's only Jinja College that cooled down. But the rest of the single schools produce commandos 😂😂😂
I won't tag them here 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Abo bakola error, seems they are the ones forming the masandugu family
Man JICO really cooled down.
The real commando training is in Northern Uganda, Western Uganda and Tororo.
Ombaci boyz squad, even police fears them
Yeah.
It's only me who's a  humble product of single schools 😂
but u koz vawolence in a simple way here

Not reached that extent.

Just know many guys are in love
I have always been rejected, so I have joined the tokola error crew, #masandugu family, tukuba
am safe, I have 1 heart and I don't want it to be broken down, koz there iz no break down service to tow it
😂😂😂
I'm going to get you a real one.
Just keep on keeping on
Man, I can't accept that, it undermines my bro rule etiquettes
Man there's nothing like breaking hearts with real ladies
I get it man
A bro iz not supposed to get a babe for a fellow bro, he iz supposed to crack the but alonr
Let me first fix her hair. I will be right back

😂😂😂😂😂
Meaning I was right 💯
mbu our diploma matters, that phrase is just funny
😂😂😂😂
But I said the whole truth 🤣🤣
Let me tell you…….
Tell me please 🤣🤣🤣
Why do you swim like that ....🫵
Observer. I always want to know those who are not meaning business
Someone was promising you jobs after our  diploma...let's wait next year isn't far...and said we shouldn't work in supermarkets for small pays😹😹😹
The truth is, we grew up from Uganda and we know how the system works .
He will be the first one to open an account on LinkedIn
The goal is having a better life. That's why I chose to become a comedian. Next month I'm having a show at Busitema University 🫵🤣
He has it already, 🤣🤣
By searching for jobs from LinkedIn....he will be even lucky to get that for 300k that he said we shouldn't work for???🤧
I have seen 🤣
Great 🤣
WELL SAID
At times if you can't control your tongue then other of your body parts suffer 🏃🏃🏃🏃
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like the ears
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THAT PROMISE😅
For long we have been sensitizing the masses that in everything we do, EVERY STEP MATTERS. Not just a fixed thing only
Yeah 👍
My guy , trhat makes sense, rather than "our diploma matters"😅
And the reality is, it's not  about the diploma, but rather excellence, competency etc.
I may lack a diploma right now, so what next
We were seeing but we left them win coz as if they are not ugandans 😹😹we ugandans we know what it means
Exactly 💯
Exactly mn
Those guys really said a lot of shit😅
YOU NEED PROTECTION MY GUY
YOU NEED TO BE PROTECTED
Just check here and thank me later. 🤣

We av pipo who a upgrading
I need you to help me with a differential equation man 😁
Some F.6 candidates are pumping me with calculus questions
Hahaha  forward  them to me...
I only know fourth degree differential equations <This message was edited>
1st order or raza...
😂
Y’all gossip more than a bunch of bored old aunties at a village meeting 🫩, act like men🧔🏻‍♂🧔🏻‍♂ and mind your own damn business.
The funny part 😂😂,you are always gossiping about people who don’t even respond to you don’t you ever get tired of wasting your energy and time ?
😂😂😂😂😂 oh God
Man don't complicate things 😁😁😁
We used it to calculate the age of the bus conductor last time of the bus accident. The same equation worked to determine what the driver was thinking at that moment
The first question was easy and I smashed it, because it was about Newton's law of cooling.
But the second one was tough.  😁😁
It seems u've not had lunch 😁😁😁🤣🤣
Can you prove your order of differential equations 🤣🤣🤣
Try again...
Ehhh man, we use those equations at CPS every day. Simple…..
Haha
Man I finally crushed it.
Now I'm here discussing mechanics, paper two. 🤣
Awo siriwo...🏃‍♂️
U ask how ASP Fred Enanga used to use the equation to generate police reports
🤣🤣🤣
It seems ur an LDU veteran 🤣🤣
Why, mechanics is the daily bread
Man, u have undermined my Rank! Check ma dp, the whole capt
Yah by the way! I use it in designing rocket trajectories 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Do you know the number of soldiers under a captain 🤣🤣
I also use it in predicting my net worth in the next months , courtesy of Descriptive Statistics and Index numbers
Ehhh man, which dictionary should I use😂😂
Btw I recently calculated the age of my grand Father's house using carbon-14 isotope
What was the half life?
Albert Einstein's scientific dictionary 😂
And the decay constant?
The half life of the house is approximately 148 years
Using carbon 14, calculate the number of IT-jobs that will be available after this diploma. And cite any references used
Man, was it there in BC or AD?
That's ur assignment 🤣😄
Use the decay constant as 0.693, half life is known and then the age of the house is 101 years. Hope you will get the answer.
Hint: you will form simultaneous equations 🤣 given the half life of carbon is 5600 years
I think uranium will be the best radioisotope to use in this case
AD

I am incredibly flamboyant for you
Guys🏃😹😹😹some people will disintegrate 🫢🫢🫢
I can see mass reigning herr
Wow. You're making me blush
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Then we shall apply binary fusion to cool the situation 😁
Hint: mitosis will be applied
The remains will be ash only😹😹
In fact it should be adopted before perilous genetic mutations occur which can change the gene pool

Your diploma won't matter about this 🫢🫢🫢
Watagwan 😁🤣🤣🤣
I have a question 🧐
Yes please!
Why is Musk delaying to bring Star link
No please 🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢
We are still directing it to use an orbit that is perpendicular to Uganda
Okay. .
But u already know the radius of the earth , why are you delaying
You know Star link has been using an orbit that is facing the North Pole at the arctic circle.
Then it's path should be concentric to the Magnetic North, not the Geographic north
Due it extreme heat, according to laws of thermodynamics, matter expands on heat [newton 1945) so due to global warning, the earth has expanded and the radius is no longer the normal
Given the law of black body radiation, we can create a solution to that
😹😹😹😹😹why can't you guys  give space for the side of Harris Camara to breath
This law has it clear that ante neutrinos and crackles of the molecular atoms vibrate vigorously upon contact with black particles
Thermodynamics and quantum theory 👯‍♂️👯‍♂️
But then we also apply Rutherford's model of an atom to address the shortcomings in Bohr's model
And consequently produce hypersonic emissions.
To replace the supersonic propagation of the waves
Did you just mean shortcomings of your diploma matters 🏃🏃🏃
You're trying to explain why with  momentum the mass is always constant 😂
I think we should apply the law of Charles Barbage
And the velocity a variable
Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO)
Which states that thou shall not use computer to attack ye privacy
Hidden meaning 🤪😹😹
And though shalt not use a computer in a way that hurts others
Wc can also be proved by induction using the matrix method as opposed to the vector method
Just printf(" we are winning . yonnah our GRC")
//Who doesn't know that😹😹 <This message was edited>
According to laws of mass destruction, the rate of enzyme activity is proportional to food available in the gut and proportional to metabolism, and ATP present at time t. On this note 📝, metabolism has demanded. I sign out.
Therefore the Adenosine Triphosphate has to take priority
In Islam we say Makthub….🖊🖊🖊
White smoke was seen coming out of the common room.
Meaning we've got a new GRC 🤝🤝✌️💪

Guys, the thing is, when u go to Rwanda under the VISIT RWANDA campaign, there are discounts that's why I adopted that
Just get money to reach Katuna boarder. In Rwanda public transport is free. Isn’t it @256767475239 ?
Its bro😊
Much respect bro🤝, but y’all need to stop yapping like girls about stuff that’s none of your business and honestly, it makes you seem bored with your own lives. Focus up real men don’t move like that.🤝
Yes it is.
As long as you reach Rwanda with your National ID and passport, transport is free.
.but if you lack proper documentation, prison straight
Especially @256763828569  ,the rest atleast 👍 <This message was edited>
Naye its martyrs season, ngenda kozesa footsubaru paka Kaduna, oba njakulipira lorry ze toke
I tried Footsubaru and TOEyota, but I highly recommend Legsus
Well bro, thanks! But I request to make a little reminder that in life every one is doing different paper and whoever cheats fails. In simple terms, every one is running his/her own race. Therefore I dint want to copy how real men do things but I love the way I do mine. So support but don’t control
Exactly. We're made from different carbon copies

TUESDAY BIBLE STUDY DEVOTION
Praise God brethren
Scripture:
And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
MEDIATATION
Jesus came to be the Savior for all people, not just a few. He offers us hope, peace, and forgiveness, and invites us to share this good news with others. We can celebrate and promote the diversity of our world, while still holding on to what makes our culture unique. Jesus is our Lord and Savior, our deliverer, and our God. He came to give us eternal life with Him.
PRAYER
Praise and thanks to you, Jesus, for revealing your plan to be the Savior of all people, including me. Please help me to spread this wonderful news to others. Amen.
Asante bro, appreciation for  this daily bread

Power Supply Unit (PSU) – Overview
A PSU converts AC (Alternating Current) from the wall into DC (Direct Current) used by computer components.
It regulates voltage to protect against surges and maintain stable operation.
---
Key Functions
1. Voltage Conversion: Converts 110V/220V AC to standard DC voltages (typically +3.3V, +5V, +12V).
2. Power Distribution: Supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, drives, and other peripherals.
3. Stability & Protection: Includes over-voltage, under-voltage, short circuit, and overload protections.
---
Main Components
Transformer: Steps down voltage.
Rectifier: Converts AC to DC.
Filter: Smooths the DC signal.
Regulator: Maintains constant output voltage.
---
Form Factors
ATX: Most common desktop PSU standard.
SFX: Smaller form factor for compact builds.
TFX/Flex ATX: Used in slim or specialized cases.
---
Efficiency Ratings (80 PLUS Certification)
Indicates energy efficiency; higher levels waste less energy as heat.
80 PLUS, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Titanium
---
Connectors
24-pin ATX: Main motherboard power.
4/8-pin CPU: Powers the processor.
6/8-pin PCIe: For graphics cards.
SATA/Molex: Power for storage devices and peripherals.
---
Considerations When Choosing a PSU
Wattage: Ensure it meets the total power requirement of the system.
Efficiency: Better efficiency = lower power bills and less heat.
Modularity:
Non-Modular: All cables fixed.
Semi-Modular: Some detachable cables.
Fully Modular: All cables detachable.
*Inductor:*
An inductor is an electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it. It resists changes in current and is often used in circuits for filtering, energy storage, and signal processing.
*Capacitor:*
A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material and is used in circuits for filtering, energy storage, and signal coupling.
Both inductors and capacitors are passive components that play crucial roles in electronic circuits, including power supplies, filters, and oscillators.
The main types of Power Supply Units (PSUs) are:
1. *Linear Power Supply*: Uses a linear regulator to regulate output voltage, often less efficient and generates more heat.
2. *Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS)*: Uses high-frequency switching to regulate output voltage, more efficient and compact.
Within these two main categories, there are various sub-types and configurations, such as:
- *ATX PSU*: A standard form factor for desktop computer power supplies.
- *SFX PSU*: A smaller form factor for compact computer builds.
- *Modular PSU*: A PSU with removable cables for better cable management.
- *Non-Modular PSU*: A PSU with fixed cables.
Additionally, PSUs can be classified based on their efficiency, such as:
- *80 PLUS Certified PSUs*: Meet specific efficiency standards, such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium.
These are some of the main types and classifications of PSUs, each with its own characteristics and applications.
*Energy Storage in a Capacitor:*
For energy to be stored in a capacitor, *current flows into* the capacitor to charge the plates, but *no current flows through* the dielectric (insulating material) between the plates.
The energy is stored in the electric field between the plates as a result of the charge separation. Once the capacitor is fully charged, the current flow stops, and the energy remains stored until the capacitor is discharged.
Here are some possible questions about Power Supply Units (PSUs) and their types:
*General PSU Questions:*
1. What is a Power Supply Unit (PSU)?
2. What is the function of a PSU in a computer system?
3. What are the different types of PSUs?
*Linear PSU Questions:*
1. What is a Linear Power Supply?
2. How does a Linear PSU regulate output voltage?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Linear PSUs?
*Switch-Mode PSU Questions:*
1. What is a Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS)?
2. How does an SMPS regulate output voltage?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SMPS?
*Comparison Questions:*
1. Compare Linear PSUs and SMPS in terms of efficiency, size, and heat generation.
2. What are the key differences between Linear PSUs and SMPS?
*Application-Specific Questions:*
1. What type of PSU is suitable for a high-power gaming PC?
2. What type of PSU is suitable for a low-power embedded system?
*Technical Questions:*
1. What is the role of inductors and capacitors in a PSU?
2. How does a PSU's efficiency affect its performance and reliability?
These questions cover a range of topics, from basic definitions to more advanced technical details.

SCRIPTURE
Psalms 16:1>>>
Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

LET'S  turn to God for protection. We can't rely on our own strength and abilities to keep us safe. We must trust in God's power and grace to guard us. The Bible reminds us that even the most vigilant can stumble, so let us put our faith in God. In these uncertain times, trusting in God is the best way to ensure our safety
PRAYER
Heavenly Father, I am so grateful for all You have done in my life. You have kept me safe and prevented the worst from happening. I trust that You will always shield me from evil and anything that could cause me harm. Please guide me to make wise decisions so I can stay out of harm's way. Amen.

I have submissions for this, give me 2 hours for it
We are waiting 2hrs to go
Aloysius where are you
*REAL LIFE FACTS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND*
1. Burial rice tastes nice until it’s cooked in your compound
2. When the axe 🪓 came to the forest 🌳, the trees 🌲 said the handle is one of us. BETRAYAL IS within.
3. When a kid grows ~up ~., a pencil ✏️ is replaced by a pen 🖊️ just to make him/her realize that now it is not easy to erase the mistake.
4. One day the ground we walk on will be our roof.
5. If loyalty was real, water 💦 is not supposed to cook 👩‍🍳 fish 🐟
6. People do not abandon people they love ❤️, they abandon people they were using.
7. How I wish RIP means Return If Possible.
8. One sad truth about life is that you may not even be part of the future you are stressed about.
9. The day you will lose your father, is the day you will realize that you have lost the only man who wanted to see you better than him.
10. The sheep 🐑 lived all it’s life fearing the wolf 🐺 but it was the shepherd that finally ate it.
11. When we were kids, we cried loudly to be noticed. But now we cry 😭 silently because we don’t want anyone to know.
12. When my mom always say, “don’t talk while eating 🥣 “ then I never knew she was talking about life.
13. Just because you have a good mom, does not mean your dad has a good wife.
14. Is this the life we were kicking 🦵 our mothers stomachs for?
15. Just because you are a good person, does not mean the world 🌎 owes you kindness.
16. When the blind man 👨‍🦯 sees, he throws away the stick that has been helping him for years.
17. Nowadays you need money 💴 to become a member of your own family.
18. FAMILY is like a FOREST 🌳 from a distance. They are all close until you get closer to see how SEPARATED trees are.
19. Just play along you no be stupid. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
*Please remain loyal to everyone*
*Have a splendid morning
💋💋💋💋💋💋

MONDAY BIBLE STUDY DEVOTION ON  26TH MAY 2025
Praise God brethren let's not forget that God word is everything
SCRIPTURE
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
-- Isaiah 61:1
KJV Holy Bible
MEDIATATION
No matter how hard life gets, Jesus is here to help. He knows us, understands us, and loves us. He came to take away the guilt of our sins and to bind up the brokenhearted. He is our Savior and our unbroken relationship with God gives us hope. No matter what is breaking apart in our lives, we can count on God to help us through it. He loves and saves us, and will help us carry our burdens.
PRAYER
Jesus, I thank You for Your love and grace that binds up my broken heart. I trust You to be with me every day, to help me through the struggles I face. I praise You for Your faithfulness and mercy. Amen.

This did not answer my question, anyone can design such a poster bro
The poster says that it's the sport's minister
I am willing to do whatever i can do for supporting the activity if at all it isn't backed up by political sit hunts..... it's not him pushing for it
Awo l gat nothing to add on
Alright, I will find out more about it from the office of the guild and act where necessary
Thank you sir 🙏

Kawedemu dda 😄😄

I wonder if our guy @275587147014313 and @264565690487034 reaches here 🤣🤣
That will be the beginning of their collapse 😂😂😂😂
Am sorry for you 😅😅😅😅🙌
And their total vanishing 🤣🤣
Exactly 😂
There's a video that I recorded, will watch it with @264565690487034 when I get back 😂😂 It's what he loves most

Katondest

Hope I have a number guys 😜🤣
Everything will be discussed tomorrow sir
I can't accept that.
You want our team to lose
The problem your afraid and jealousy of me😹😹but whether what am playing midfield
null
First of all, you last played football in August 2023 😂😂😂
💃💃💃
But talent remains talent bro😹😹
Talent beats hard work 💪
Hard Work beats talent bro.
I have many examples to give 😂
Keep with your examples..but it was proved talent beats hard work 😀
Talent + hard work = performance + money
Talent - hard work  = performance  - money
😂😂🫢
I hope u get it
Hope your not thinking of penaldo and messi😹😹
If not then think about it
But come Thursday am scoring goals😹
I just know you will go to sweat and come out with excuses 😂😂😂
Better remain home and sleep 😂😂😂 that day
But if I don't score then I will blame the team for not creating for me chances😹😹
Though u might be speaking the truth 🫢🫢
And this is what you were up to 😹😹😹
Yet u call yourself a midfielder . 😂😂🫢
else:
print("Bennet will warm the bench 😂🫢") <This message was edited>
It's ok if I don't play ...
Then our GRC will play number 9..
Success GRC😹
Now if u start that ..
Am seeing segregation in you coz I should start those games ... every one knows it
You want our team to have the likes of Hojlund 😂😂🫢
Bro u won't start unless you start exercising. Your body is full of fatty acids and glycerol 😂😂😂 <This message was edited>
Then he won't even be on he player list 😂😂
He already failed the medical tests 😂😂😂
No play time for you 😄😄
So you have resorted to displaying our health here 😹😹
For the sake of tye game's vetting, I had to do the needful
Remember that was the stomach, I withheld that of the chest 🔥
Anyway guys ...
Let's all stand together and come support our boys on Thursday ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
That's all. We were advertising for the game.... let's get onto the meeting in big numbers tomorrow guys
Our ladies, prepare to give the greatest support to our mighty team on Thursday ❤ 🙌
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please don't post that of the chest. It's worse I guess 😂😂
It even requires an MRI scan
And remember in football it's finance that will make the team win..
So any coin is highly welcomed..just inbox the organising team and support
Mukama, the guy is still breast feeding so he needs pepsinogen
But let's first agree that u won't play 😂😂😂 <This message was edited>
He even lacks salivary amylase enzyme
Remember I have qualities of being a captain 😀 don't forget that also😹
Don't make me cry 😢
Wc captain can take 2 years without training.
😹😹😹😹 don't forget my words of talent
Bro I'm taking you to Nsambya hospital tomorrow for medical tests.
Then after we shall publish the results 😂😂😂
Colleagues don't u think that we shud ask the lecturer for workshop to mark the paper we did today out of 60,then we go look for 30 in the end of sem
Btw how was the paper
You know us evening guys always admire day guys 😅
Ask the lecturer coz I Mae make an error here🫣🫣🫣🫣
You guys do many tests and definitely pass more than us who are mainly tourists 😂😂
He said that u people overpassed the  centralized test that is y he decided to give us another test to cater 4 us also
The problem is that u people over pass centralized test
He was wrong 😭
The Centralized test smashed me like juice 😢
Haa u dodge nuclear on earth u go to heaven for hell
Oh my God.
He was trying to talk in the opposite way may be
First tell me how the test was
It was lyk a new curriculum physics paper
Okay
Meaning it's doable to some extent
Qtns like imagine you a given not working computer so do ur best to make it work, 10 marks
Assume, doing things on assumptions 🫣🫣🫣
Those ones have no specific answer I think. You give what you think is right and wait for your 25 out of 30 😂😂
Eeeeeeh 😂😂😂
Kati assume @173830513389709  and @169754891436280  are in the mid field of DCs ,,,,,,, @89512017395931  do ur work
We will see on training sessions
Ok
😹😹😹😹😹
Then @154644978393101 as our halland 💃💃💃
Haaaaa, he will instead be lyk Houjland
Or Darwin Nunes
Exactly 😹😹😹🫢🫢🫢🫢
First of all, there would be a straight red card of @169754891436280
And then @173830513389709 would score an own goal to successfully sink the team.
😂😁😁😁
If @154644978393101 plays no.9 then it would indicate that no ball touches for him 😂 <This message was edited>
First post the line up we see
Players are not yet confirmed.
Tomorrow we're screening them after trials
Who is going to handle medical trials @173830513389709  will u survive the trials
He won't survive in anyway. 😃😃😃
Gwe
We're ready for this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 <This message was edited>

Some colleague from weekend class asked who teaches day students but I'm not aware of his name.
Because I'm for evening class
Bwire john, that's his name
But generally we call him mzee
🙏🙏
Thanks so much 👍
Actually mzee is very good title for us who are aged.
It's young boys like @173830513389709 who dislike such titles 😂😂
Did @173830513389709 tell you his real age 😳 🤔
Dude's age mates are all dead
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
My circle was the likes of pope, queen Robert Mugabe <This message was edited>
Meaning my 40 years are nothing to the age of @173830513389709 😂😂😂😂
He is 5 days younger than Pope Leo XIV <This message was edited>

3. Finance - Any amount contributed will greatly support the progress of the tournament because it's us the students funding our team. However the participation fee has been cleared
4. Player selection - at least 20 players required
5. DCS year one target - winning the trophy
6. Team wear - jersey is sorted. Players are expected to report with their own boots and black stockings

Your resilience, enthusiasm, and commitment mean the world to me. I'm honored to stand alongside such a passionate and driven Team. The vibes and good moments we had together will forever be cherished. Thank you for your tireless efforts and unwavering support. Let's keep pushing boundaries and making our voices heard.🙏💕.

OK guyz to stop rebellions here, let's stop ko posting political drama here, koz it's the main agenda behind these wars
Continue cleaning for him,u will find yourself brushing his teeth just to buy favour
Surely 100% I do support what you say
At times try to mind yo language by acting mature and trying to mind yo business at times, if the person decided to do that, that was at his own will not u to speak shit out, its better u inbox that person privately and diss yo selves as men
For the best cause he is the man
I love objective people
Not people moved by just a note of money
That’s shiii
Honestly according to the “tells” at campus don’t even know kyaligonza but all I know he still gat a lot to do in terms of real influence let’s just wait for the ballot
Even himself he feels the impact 😂😂😂🥲
Fuck them
Always open wide,

Man thats a turn off
Real people don’t go for money
Quality talk and objective minds matter a lot than some one who just stands up in his old age mbu what what 😂😂😂😂😂
Not taking sides here but if the shoe fits let the owner take it
That’s the problem with kyaligonza fans
Not even voters
They think negatively not objectively
Now when I say u have along way to go do u argue bro 😂😂😂😂
Be logical not crowd pleasing man
Grow up
And others are given empty promises and are fucked freely
😂😂😂
They can't understand <This message was edited>

Great 👍
No, I like this holiday but not happy with what Mwanga did.
Actually I'm planning to sue  his descendants <This message was edited>
🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️ His grand children are the ones disturbing people?
@173830513389709 how are you doing
He was right 👍
We even have 5 of them at UICT 2 in DCS
And another thing if he didn't kill them we would have lectures today 🫢🫢
🤔
But how many times did you even attend lectures this semester 😂
I personally disagree with him because his submission has no concrete evidence
True, those are rumors
I'm pretty sure they're less than 10
🤣🤣🤣
@173830513389709 prove me wrong

But with you it doesn't require public holidays to chop lectures, because chopping is your daily bread 😁
What matters is the roll call says I attended more than 75%.. argue with your keyboard 😹
🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️ How can it be? Who signed those roll calls 😂
That's it.
Then plus the 3 days for the tests , that's 7 days at campus for this semester 😁
Very correct 😂
Meaning you always sign remotely 😄😄

*Critical Implementation Concerns:*
1. How will you secure funding for equipment upgrades when institutional budgets are typically fixed? What specific partnerships with tech companies have you already established, or are these just aspirational goals? Can you guarantee WiFi infrastructure improvements given the college's likely limited IT budget and bureaucratic approval processes?
2. Your internship promises require external cooperation - what contingency plans exist if companies decline participation? Government program access depends on ministry relationships you may not possess. The timeline for these ambitious changes remains unclear, and student leadership positions typically last one year with limited administrative authority.
3. What measurable benchmarks will demonstrate progress, and how will you maintain momentum when facing inevitable institutional resistance to rapid technological changes?
I am asking these for the good of a class that needs more of a passionate, creative and accountable leadership.
Bro don't kill pipo tonight
We need everyone alive for Thursday 🙏
But @61427226308710
How a u going to add in de internship stuff like seriously 😂😂😂...mbu u gat connections for everyone

Juh bless you for , that guy wasn't specific
Mr Trent am sorry this is an assistance with AI to help me structure my ideas . Kindly adopt the use of technology, we are in a digital error. But for whatever your seeing there the background is from my head, they are my ideas that I prompted.
1::: Through negotiations with the administration, procurements always differ Boss according to the specifics needed,
2:::: For internships am to forward the way I think to the guild council and the institute administration at large to help establish that system for our own good.
All in all am to work hard  and cooperate with the offices in power to help us achieve whatever am standing on.
Bro this is gonna be a battle for me to bring all these on table.
I can not allow to be guilty
PICK UNDERSTANDING
I understand papa
This is a digital error wama
THANKS THEN, HELP ME PICK WHAT I AM TRYING TO PUT BEFORE YOUR TABLE FOR A PURPOSE

Fellow Muslims, dont forget to fast the day of Arafah tomorrow. Fasting on the Day of Arafah and repenting for your sins defeats Shaytaan, who tempted you to commit past sins. It is the greatest day of the Islamic Year.
“Fasting on the day of Arafah expiates the sins from the past and coming year.” (Muslim). And lets put KYALIGONZA BRIAN  and ALOYSIOUS in our prayers too. <This message was edited>

Yo Chief
To our opponent, Kyaligonza Brian, I offer my heartfelt congratulations. We may have disagreed along the way, but I know that we share a deep love for this institute and a strong commitment to its future. I urge every student to come together now,to heal, to find common ground, and to build a future that we can all be proud of. Let’s remember that no matter the outcome, we are one family, united by the spirit of UICT. Let’s not lose hope. Together, we can make our dreams a reality.

@264565690487034 wat did you learn yesterday
thanks my brother for that  wonderful question. ...
let me highlight them
Fear women 😁😁😁
🙌🙌🙌
Atte how have women got involved in this
1.Always have respect for people,calling us animals during the debate
2.Never campaign with Impossible manifestos,things like u want to build for us the football pitch,u want change for us the gate with UICT logo etc
3.Listen to the Association and behave accordingly
4.Look for Experienced people to be on the field of campaigns not wewe all the time
5.Do not try to bite wat u can't chew
6.Finally,our sisters have suffered during this campaigns becoz hmmmmm <This message was edited>
Hhhm..🙌🙌
You know why
For ?! 🙂
I also don't know
Believe and love for your candidate
Ok
For me I conclude by saying that it's all about using your money very well
Very good, behavior is key 👍
They all had money but how it was invested was the case
It's funny how political analysts have increased😂
Remember on the Final rally, Bankruptcy had hit one camp 🤔
😂😂😂😊
Iwee
Wewe not bankruptcy 😂😂😂😂
i realised where the money was going, fear women 🤣🤣🤣
I suggest we move up straight cause more harm is being done than before the voting. This should have been advise to your candidates before the voting kati now mbu since results are out bulyomu amanyi politics now🫩
🤐😂
Kare now which team are you yonah or Aloysius

And to my leaders (incoming)..the ballot is louder than those bu voices shouting.
> Team Yonah

Wewewe
GRCS ALONE
But @61427226308710, we can not go on polls without having a discussion before our people, I would like to give you something real 😁😁 <This message was edited>
It's me and my brother Yonnah
Kasta wayambadde Yellow, nemanya mitawaAn
Bro yo not worthy for that position

How do you feel wen u post out my pics everywhere yet u fear to post yourself 😂😂
Thanks for adding something to my name 🙏
Ebyo bibyo, Same way u said Brian is not worthy. Guess who is the 16th Guild now😂
Yonnah, my brother, I feel you.
We can’t just walk people into a vote without first giving them a voice. These are real lives, real concerns — not just numbers on a ballot.
Before polls, we need presence. We need to sit with our people, understand their fears, their hopes, and let them speak. That’s how trust is built.
Let’s not lead from above — let’s walk with them, beside them. That’s what real leadership looks like.
And this beautiful lady @152042161090765 🙏❤️
@Dorah had intentions bro🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
He's sick
Colleagues, I am now bringing out leadership in my brother, allow us have that moment please
A beg don't tag her

Aaaaaahhhh
WIC differently sir are u meaning 😑
Hey folks,
I want to sincerely thank all of yuh who joined me on the podcast as we discussed the previous presidential elections and the upcoming GRC elections. We covered a lot in those 48 minutes, and it was a truly engaging session.
That said, the ongoing feud between Alvin and Rajab should now be referred to the DCS Executive Committee for resolution 🙏. Let’s allow the appropriate channels to handle it.
As for the GRC elections, we all know the candidates well and deep down, we each know who we believe should lead and it’s either Alozious or Yona. Remember, voting is both a right and a responsibility and most importantly, it’s an act of free will that no one should force you to vote for who you don’t want.
Please make time on Tuesday to show up and cast your vote for the candidate you believe in.
Wishing everyone a good night and see you at the polls.

Together 💪
We're unstoppable
Thats it,
Y need buildings😂😂
One love
No need for buildings .
Actually I saw this stuff at Victoria University. The guys even have 100% online exams . And the unique thing with them is that you can't paste any answers
But I they can use two phones 😁
This should be introduced soon
Exactly
Let's support it 😁
✅
When a we voting
🤣😂😂😂🤣
Remember the answers are first checked through AI systems for plagiarism checks
But I can also check them and humanize them😁
In this regime we shall advocate for it.
Sometimes there's no need to go to campus especially for lectures that require no lab practice
📌📌📌📌
@~1 MOLE <This message was edited>
But remember time will be counting down 🤣
Even lab practice should be online
With IT everything is possible
Yes Hon. Yonah. This a serious issue especially for those having some work, those that live in distant places and to the married
Exactly.
Noted ✅ It will be worked on
Actually we shall have to discuss all these issues in our meeting at 8 pm .
Ok
Even the marrieds
Now i see the reason
We shall engage the concerned stake holders
1. H. E Kyaligonza Brian

Lectures are surely needed from @155680166150382 And our GRC <This message was edited>
How did you reach A level 🤣
Sarah needs a minister  seat in da govt coz she worked alot
Sarah has some dangerous dance moves 😁🤣
I never knew shortcuts in computer science
You people aloysius was dancing like an old man. Like a drunkard
Very dangerous banaye
Av u yet seen our grc
I agree with you on that
Yet he was sober
I doubt
I've not healed from GRC' s dance moves 😁🤣🙌
I give up🙌🏾😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wabula😂😂😂😂🙌
But did u see yourself almost knocking pipo
Ask lagos coz they shared the same drinking water
Tooo dangerous😂😂
He was feeling the dance n music😂😂
She was dancing from the perspective of a kungfu master 🤣🤣🤣
Hahahahaha
Surely 😂😂
I haven't healed yet 😁
Oba we force this relationship 😂😂😂🙌
You people our GRC nedda
That's what I was also seeing
Tokola error
Alimba
Drunkard style was da next move😂😂
Hahahahahaa Tyra
Surely 😂😅
A u also a member of shadow govt
Even eagle crow 😅😂😂
Due to the votes collected today
We shall have a friendly match on Friday
Time will be communicated.....
Those opposing the match won't be allowed to be part of the team😂😂but don't worry
We are all one 👊
Let our own GRC work on this preparation for the match
Thanks 🙏
Go forward😂😂😂
Remember the GRC need to have his first lady also 😁😁
Seriously😜
Btw why didn't you try this stroke 😁😁
True
Exactly
But guys leaving GRC aside, at least he can dance.
Just watch @154644978393101 dance, u will thank me later 😅😅😅🤣🤣
Yap
Am also wondering y they didnt do it
Olugambo
Should I send the video here and you see for yourself 🤣
I know he z gonna dance lyk our grc, even better buh same dance moves😂😂
Dont send
Yonah🥹🥹🥹
No please 🤣🤣
He just jumps and appears like someone is kicking space 😂😂😁
Where is it please  jst forward
Hahaha😂😂😂
M already imagining Yonah dancing
Hehe
Naye Ssuubi, ndeka
Like lagos
Atee Lagos is a dangerous substitute
Mulikunyiga banamwe 😹😹😹
Just a moment 😄
With his bag
If I send the video you won't sleep 😄😁😁😁
Cuz u may laugh trans night 😂
Haha,
How??
Let me rest please
Hahaha,
Lagos is someone else wz his bag😂
Someone to drop that ka video please
Please forward😂😂
Lagos is another legend. He doesn't dance but imagines dancing 😁🤣🙌
Sarah drop the video😂😂
He has perfect dance moves in his head but he fails to do them physically😂😂
Association members wait to confirm reading periods after seeing coursework marks
Exactly 😂
But if given the chance to mentor someone, he would be the perfect coach of dancers 😂😂
He is soon coming to defend himself 🤣🤣🤣
Exactly😂😂😂
Waiting
At your own risk. The reading started a long time ago . The association actually set a new target, at least second class upper. No jokes
The guy is now far away, in the East 😂😂
Chief whip @169754891436280 is ready to execute whosoever won't get atleast 1st class upper
Exactly. We want our association to produce competent and skilled hackers, full stack developers, Network engineers, IT technicians and consultants ✌️
Tomorrow we shall have a road map shared here
What abt producing skilled lecturers like Kamba
That's all, mine you i started Hitting winter yesterday 🤣
So expect papers to feel my energy this time round 😹😹😹
That's obvious, in the modern world, lecturers are not produced. But rather guys in the respective fields take up the teaching and skilling of learners
Then for us who didn't do the prac
Keep it up bro.
And be reminded that we shall sit near each other 😄
We are working on that, by Monday, we shall have an assurance for those people
Assured.
✌️
Bro, another thing i should remind with my bros here, ladies are disciplining us badly with marks 😹😹😹 I don't know where we are showing them our manhood <This message was edited>
Let's do something this time round
Alright class coordinator. We wait
Be rest assured
I can't believe that @13361794265286 was better than me in computer workshop practice 😂
Exactly 😂
Tell a bro to tell a bro that our ladies must consult from us please 🙏
🙌🙌🤣
When shall we start🙏🏾
It started on Monday
Immediately you see that message from the board, start because you're 2 days late
Eeh
2 days! Alright
Yep.
And be reminded that the papers are not merely metallic but alloys
Understood sir 😪, but improve on communication.
Please 🙏 we regret any inconveniences caused by poor communication and beg to be corrected where need be .
waa...we need  compensation 😂 <This message was edited>
U can please point out the vulnerability in our communication and we fix it ASAP 😁
Always at your service sir.
😁😁✌️
Formations or more time...let the board choose one
With time it's non-negotiable 😁😁
Even formations, there's no guarantee 😁😁
I recommend @82008525037813 🏃🏃🏃
@223738050179326 come here small small 🤣🤣
But the assurance is that we shall pass by all means ✌️😁
Banaye😂😂😂😂
What do you say about the love for you to become the GRC's bag holder ☺️
@223738050179326 is still in power 😁😁🤣🤣🙌
I see lagos with a lady's bag 🤣🤣🤣

Hahahaha let him come down
He needs serious counselling
But wat is really wrong with him cz he wasn't supposed to be there
He was free to be in that room, but he occupied the wrong seats that were respectively reserved for the honorable members, his seat was just besides. And as a result, he was requested to sit in his appropriate gazetted area, that's where he started the drama <This message was edited>

Some answer here
@154644978393101
The lecturer didn't inform me of any test, maybe @61427226308710 knows the arrangements
The lecturer always communicates to group A students in their admin whatsapp group about any advancement, notes, test, or coursework etc, but I didn't hear anything from him as far as this test is concerned
😂😂where is @61427226308710 come tell us 😊
Thank you my boss

Pin this message
Wait at 7

Mmmm
GRC is a legit man

no need for clarification
I was telling u nga oli awo
What is fake
Are you sure of what you are saying?
AM SURE
Yonah please confirm pressure
It's a document from the lecturer himself
Your excel doesn't show the author of the text
He should recount staff
have you checked on him and got full details about it, the document  has just been made  now by someone else
Then these guys should accept
Author is JOB
wHO IS job
I am just from talking to him man, he sent it using his whatsapp number in our class group
If you can't accept it. I will let you go ahead and wait for the authentic one
yes am waiting
If they are still opposing, let them go to mzee by themselves on Monday for clarity, boss they shouldn't over disturb u
This was sent at 11:07
who is disturbing who
who is disturbing who
Alright, Christ will get you waiting... colleagues consider those marks, it's from the lecturer himself
This is showing 11:24
Who is the idiot here
The guys who sent
U are disturbing yonah
We shall handle the issues on the sheet and produce an updated list by Tuesday
at what time did Yonah receive it
ok sir
Look at the time it was created after being sent
Is it possible
am confused
i cant accept
Just relax and wait for Tuesday
okay sawa
Is Ur phone out dated or the ISSUE is with the mark sheet
He was adding 5marks for the course work that we did in groups , that's why maybe some people are above 40
i have seen someone with 44, 45, and 41 respectively, a lot of mispelt names.
maybe both
Bambi inbox the man privately pliz, koz no one else here can answer the query over the marks
Konna Ku mzee
someone add him to  the group
add him here
U want to boil his nose
i want to cook him
Have respect for lecturers pliz, this is a group for other things maybe we add him to the other group not this one
who said i dont respect lecturers
the bad thing is you think you are more clever than the lecturer who sent them smh!
Pliz he iz older than yo parents pliz in fact agemates ov yo grandies
do i have any case of that kind
Yo words
Ezo zebayita Ai generated marks 🤭😂

This shouldnt come out from you my leader😂
Night shift calm down  bru
am calm, bro, but education shouldnt be humiliated to that extent. Some of our parents are earning because of Education🥹
We all dont knw wat z ryt ???let's burn da issue and we investigate  wats right then we Judge
I am not being judgmental, but education is so crucial, other factors remain constant <This message was edited>
I understand  but let's jst liv it as da way it's  coz many a unemployed  bt educated  jst look into dat and our unemployment  rate is by oba 42% in Uganda
I agree with u in dat
but we should not blame education in that instance, its not education to employ us. <This message was edited>
Yap bt da primary goal of education  z to eliminate  illiteracy  nt job creation <This message was edited>
well said
Rajab, when Yonah says education is a scam, he’s not belittling education, it’s a deeper perspective that many haven’t fully grasped yet. I believe you may have misunderstood his point, but I genuinely hope that one day you’ll see it from that angle too.
It’s not about debating, it’s about recognizing a reality many of us are starting to wake up to. Going to school is a journey meant to prepare us for life, yes, but the system of education, as it stands, often feels like a scam. On that, I completely agree with my two brothers above
what does the word scam mean
Good question. The word "scam" usually means a dishonest scheme or fraud, but in this context, it doesn't mean education itself is useless. It means the system often promises success through schooling, yet many graduates still struggle to find jobs or achieve what they were told education would guarantee. So when someone says "education is a scam," they’re criticizing how the system operates, not the value of knowledge or learning itself. It's more about real life results not matching the promises made.
Education is not a scam, it just feels like because our system focuses only on grades, not real skills, and we’re taught outdated content that doesn’t match real-world needs. but all in all Education is not a scam
I get where you’re coming from, and I agree that the core of education, gaining knowledge and skills, is important. But when people say “education is a scam,” they’re not attacking learning itself. They’re calling out the system that pushes grades over skills, outdated content over relevant knowledge, and makes people believe that a degree alone guarantees success. That’s the part that feels misleading,and that’s why many of us call it a scam.
Have a blessed night
The problem is that you are addicted to AI🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
CONTINUE
But I believe education is not a scum if you know wat to do. Nothing is for free in this life. Dive in it do the necessities, prepare your self yes u will thank me later. A good morning.
Have you heard your self, "if you know what to do", That's where I put my emphasis . But anyway let's leave this statement of education being a scam. Because many are going to believe it and many are going to be against it.... but all in all it's a matter of time.
Bcoz. scam and we are still in school ?😄
shared a two sided argument about school...its not a scam, its just not the end-all-be-all secret to success.
Omanyi abavukuva they gather in their own bu small groups taking malwa and start these bi stories
Gwe,leave marua alone
It's culture boss
Tell him
Am seeing some young boy 14 years graduating with a degree in mathematics. Started doing calculus when he was 6 , me I did calculus when I was 16 , no scum is here
Commitment is the key
👍
It's a deeper perspective that many haven't fully grasped yet. I think I can't convince you because we have different thinking . But going to school is a journey meant to prepare us for life but it can't change the fact that it's a scam. Am not saying you don't need to go to school.
I can't believe this 🤔🤣🤣
Iz this AI thinking oba human, koz the grammar seems created by AI hahaha
The education is right. The Ugandan system just isn't it ✅ <This message was edited>
It's you to decide whether it's AI content or human content
Anha truth its AI, that's the decision
Fine.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Praise God everyone
The workshop mzee has done it ,he will correct the education sector
Amen.
Colleagues just believe that its happening on Sunday ad we will all make it
Motivation 👍
everybody's perception towards a subject is always right..facts n myths about a particular subject is what concurs with them or disagrees with them. its not malwa <This message was edited>
Lets not give up
But lets work it out together
Finals are just few days to come but the mission is that how are we going to make it out together
All of us
Our target is to be in the tent with our friends on the graduation day but how are we helping eachother to be there......
This semester has had ups and downs to some of us but if it has been good to u...atleast help out a friend with the solution on how them can manage it too
GOOD MORNING GUYS

Someone  studied calculus at 16yrs so nw u a 18yrs doing diploma
Don't comment 🤣🤣🤣
People yap
Am me not someone
Boss I attended a math contest in s.4 I was in 36 position in ug, at form six I did a math contest I was in the 10th position in ug, so if u know maths contest exam then u can relate, that was form 3 I started my preparations.
Anyways do u know the questions asked in that paper, acknowledge
I won't argue in uganda everything z  possible bt age is jst a namba bt in form 4 u were in 36th position in Uganda it's ok
If they were 36 participants
It's ok
According  to qtns of calculus someone  in form 4 cant attempt any coz it's not part of da syllabus
Visit maths contest paper,🤣🤣🤣 gwe musaja it's not about syllabus,if it was syllabus u would also have done it🤣🤣
Differentiate btn Ur bu papers and maths contest papers.
Oba mayb am lost and confused bt I dont think u a serious at all coz I mayb saying calculus  and u a interpreting  dat it's a use of a calculator
Let's chill the issue.
Those who ever have done calculus  can related
Owangude
Atte hw yet u were among da best in uganda in da contest let jst dive deeper in calculus .....! which topic do u think is easier in calculus?????🫵
This statement, I can't have a conversation with you basically in maths
We a one team if u passed 'A' Level its one of da hardest levels i knw
Wat I knw da truth z bitter
It's ok
So guys should we think this sem's lecturers ain't serious with there eyes or what coz these mistakes of our reg  numbers are alarming banange hopefully we shall not have issues with marks on our portals .. anyway guys
*Lets try to increase ko on the letters we will write starting Friday*🙏🙏😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Main objective of this information 🤷‍♂️
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes lagos
I need now the proposal of the essay u guys were discussing poorly, i missed
You guys are making my day
Age nt matching with academic experience
My biggest concern as far as life is concerned is to have the bag of the money 💰 🙃
Best of all
This is da current  goal
oooh,now matching with saugage over🤣
Reasoning
All the same, it was high school past
Now here is where we start building the real hustle out there
Esy bt no room for forging da past imagine lying on da CV
but u forgot one word, always use it where necessary
Hihihi
Besides this let's advocate for online papers.
At least 2 should be online then 3 physical, starting next semester
This is the main reason.
The rest should be regarded as noise ✌️
Money 💰💵💵
Eeee
That's it bro.
1. Put God first
2. Chase the bag
No other drama ✌️
Actually.
> 3. No other drama
.
Exactly bro 💪
The cycle continues...
1. Put God first
2. Chase the bag
3. No other drama
✌️💵💰🤑
That aside, ba guy mumpe ku bu gig l also try option 2 without option 3 😄
I have a gig for creating a website.
Let's team up .
Deal 🤝 <This message was edited>
That was the target😂😂
I am alrdy imagining myself doing software paper online😂😂
Deal yes or no
Eh eh mukama wange..your inbox already has Three messages from me sir🙏🏾
Actually we shall achieve it.
There's no way a leading ICT institution can rely on physical things only, what's the use of the online platforms. Some of us lose a lot of money and opportunities trying to be physical at campus 😁
Next semester, we shall have a balance, opting in for at least  50% online tests , exams and lectures
Am soon losing my marriage because of campus😂
Buh i also have another suggestion,
equality for all,
Let blind people start supervising physical examz
But I wanted you to lose it so that I also start a new chapter 🙈🙈
If we have them at UICT, they will supervise
So that has been your prayer all along😔,
No wonder thea have been rangles at my home
Nice then
Equality for all
I can explain please.
Should I come over 😉
I dont trust that explanation
I'm on my way, I will explain better physically
Have you prepared some lunch 😎
Eeeh,
Am i safe???
Am at campus😂
Very safe . I'm even coming with some 🎁🎁🎁
Tomorrow is also a day please. 🤣
When i was young, i was told not to accept gifts from strangers
But am alrdy thea
At least let me bring and you refuse them physically
But ur location is not reading Nakawa 🤣🤣
What is it reading
👀👀
I'm even disappointed.
Let me call my brother now .
Expect another wrangle this evening
Hahaha,
Am a computer sciencetist as you,
I will just alter my location
I'm a master in Forensics. I gat ur real location
Tell her, so she understands why we are ever online 😂😂
We monitor the space
That's how I got @13361794265286 cheating on me 🤣🤣
24/7
I love Tech guys, this discipline gat everything it requires to make us have the bag 🎒 at our youngest ages
That's it Commander.
We should just stay focused and aim at the target.
Better days are coming.
Exactly 💯. But it calls for hardwork and the burning desire to learn new things daily, it doesn't need laziness
Exactly.
But I have an issue, if I fail the end of semester exams , I'm not doing well. I'm broken hearted 💔
And even the person who broke me is here wit us
I know the problem, @171820737159359 and @13361794265286 will pay for it, I will face them kimafia 🔥
😂😂😂 gud for u
Feel it 😁
Let that pain sink deep
They even went with my wig that I bought, at least let them return it, I will sell to others
Exactly
Because of why 🤣
1 mole I have here an idea to implement but I will need a front end dev basically it must be in a mobile dev ,
Sooka onsomelemu
Jst feel it
Lesson well learned
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ate nkozekyi banange 😃😃
Just pray we don't meet at campus 😎
Bannange
Ruth please go and solve things before the sun sets ✨ 🙏
Just leave @13361794265286 alone if you want peace
💔💔💔
@13361794265286 you declare publicly.
Who do you go with 😎
Yes, this will help us solve things peacefully, but @13361794265286 remember I have a pistol 🔫 😉 before you say anything
And she should not forget that I have her ATM card.
We are still very safe and in high standing of ownership bro💃💃💃🥳🥳🥳
Exactly
And I even have the contacts of her home place. Any mistake I can call and create trouble
